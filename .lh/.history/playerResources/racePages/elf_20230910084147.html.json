They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.</p>\r\n        <hr class=\"my-4\">\r\n        <div class=\"monsterImageContainer\">\r\n            <img class=\"monsterPortrait rounded\" src=\"../../images/elf.png\" alt=\"Elf image\">\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"btn-group\" role=\"group\" aria-label=\"Basic example\">\r\n            <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" href=\"#collapseStats\" role=\"button\"\r\n                aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapseBasic\" onclick=\"scrollToStats()\">Traits</button>\r\n            <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" href=\"#collapseLore\" role=\"button\"\r\n                aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapseBasic\" onclick=\"scrollToLore()\">Lore</button>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <!-- Start collapseStats -->\r\n        <div class=\"collapse\" id=\"collapseStats\">\r\n            <h4>Traits</h4>\r\n            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n            <p>Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of elven refinement.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Dexterity score increases by 2.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Age:</span> Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claim s adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Alignment:</span> Elves love freedom , variety, and sel-fexpression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. The drow are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Size:</span> Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Speed:</span> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Darkvision:</span> Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Keen Senses:</span> You have proficiency in the Perception skill.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Fey Ancestry:</span> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Trance:</span> Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Languages:</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Subrace:</span> Ancient divides among the elven people resulted in three main subraces: high elves, wood elves, and dark elves, who are commonly called drow. Choose one of these subraces. In some worlds, these subraces are divided still further (such as the sun elves and moon elves of the Forgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can choose a narrower subrace.</p>\r\n\r\n            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n            <h6>High Elf</h6>\r\n            <p>As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds of D&D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type (which includes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk. the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.</p>\r\n            <p>The sun elves of Faerun (also called gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with gold.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Intelligence score increases by 2.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Elf Weapon Training:</span> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Cantrip:</span> You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Extra Language:</span> You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.</p>\r\n\r\n            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n            <h6>Wood Elf</h6>\r\n            <p></p>\r\n            <p></p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> </p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Elf Weapon Training:</span> </p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Fleet of Foot:</span> </p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Mask of the Wild:</span> </p>\r\n\r\n            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n            <h6>Dark Elf (Drow)</h6>\r\n            <p></p>\r\n            <p></p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> </p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Superior Darkvision:</span> </p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Sunlight Sensitivity:</span> </p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Drow Magic:</span> </p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Drow Weapon Training:</span> </p>\r\n\r\n            \r\n        </div>\r\n        <!-- End collapseStats -->\r\n        <!-- Start collapseLore -->\r\n        <div class=\"collapse\" id=\"collapseLore\">\r\n            <div class=\"dropdown\">\r\n                <button class=\"btn btn-secondary dropdown-toggle\" type=\"button\" id=\"dropdownMenuButton\"\r\n                    data-toggle=\"dropdown\" aria-haspopup=\"true\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\r\n                    Lore\r\n                </button>\r\n                <div class=\"dropdown-menu\" aria-labelledby=\"dropdownMenuButton\">\r\n                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#shortAndStout\">Short and Stout</a>\r\n                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#longMemoryLongGrudges\">Long Memory, Long Grudges</a>\r\n                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#clansAndKingdoms\">Clans and Kingdoms</a>\r\n                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#godsGoldAndClan\">Gods, Gold, and Clan</a>\r\n                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#dwarfNames\">Dwarf Names</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n            <div id=\"shortAndStout\">\r\n                <h5>Short and Stout</h5>\r\n                <p>Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though\r\n                    they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a\r\n                    human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any\r\n                    of the larger folk.</p>\r\n                <p>Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are\r\n                    light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is\r\n                    usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their\r\n                    beards highly and groom them carefully.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n            <div id=\"longMemoryLongGrudges\">\r\n                <h5>Long Memory, Long Grudges</h5>\r\n                <p>Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often rem em ber a very\r\n                    different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of\r\n                    the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the\r\n                    fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a\r\n                    perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.</p>\r\n                <p>Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with\r\n                    stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their\r\n                    ancestry back to the founding o f their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and\r\n                    don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the\r\n                    dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the\r\n                    forge.</p>\r\n                <p>Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to\r\n                    the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense o f justice, and they are slow to forget\r\n                    wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf’s entire clan, so\r\n                    what begins as one dwarf’s hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n            <div id=\"clansAndKingdoms\">\r\n                <h5>Clans and Kingdoms</h5>\r\n                <p>Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals\r\n                    and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry,\r\n                    and in some dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can’t find in their\r\n                    mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings\r\n                    frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are\r\n                    welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them.</p>\r\n                <p>The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves\r\n                    who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan identities and affiliations, recognize\r\n                    related dwarves, and invoke their ancestors’ names in oaths and curses. To be clanless is the worst\r\n                    fate that can befall a dwarf.</p>\r\n                <p>Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially weapon smiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some\r\n                    become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after for their courage and loyalty.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n            <div id=\"godsGoldAndClan\">\r\n                <h5>Gods, Gold, and Clan</h5>\r\n                <p>Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a desire for treasure—for its own\r\n                    sake, for a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help others. Other dwarves are\r\n                    driven by the com m and or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to bring\r\n                    glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek\r\n                    to restore a clan’s lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place\r\n                    within the clan after having been exiled.
