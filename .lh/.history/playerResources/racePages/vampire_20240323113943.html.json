      <p>Within the shadows lurk those whose existence teeters between the realms of the living and the undead.\r\n            Vampires, once mortals cursed with eternal night, now navigate a delicate balance between their insatiable\r\n            thirst for blood and the remnants of their former selves. Though shrouded in mystery and often feared by\r\n            those who dwell in the light, vampires possess a profound allure, drawing adventurers into their world of\r\n            darkness and intrigue. Whether bound by a thirst for power, driven by a quest for redemption, or simply\r\n            seeking to survive in a world that shuns them, vampires weave their stories into the tapestry of countless\r\n            realms, forever dancing on the edge between salvation and damnation.</p>\r\n        <hr class=\"my-4\">\r\n        <div class=\"monsterImageContainer\">\r\n            <img class=\"monsterPortrait rounded shadow-lg\" src=\"../../images/vampire.png\" alt=\"Vampire image\">\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"btn-group\" role=\"group\" aria-label=\"Basic example\">\r\n            <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" href=\"#collapseStats\" role=\"button\"\r\n                aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapseBasic\" onclick=\"scrollToStats()\">Traits</button>\r\n            <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" href=\"#collapseLore\" role=\"button\"\r\n                aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapseBasic\" onclick=\"scrollToLore()\">Lore</button>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <!-- Start collapseStats -->\r\n        <div class=\"collapse rounded\" id=\"collapseStats\">\r\n            <h4>Traits</h4>\r\n            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n            <p>Vampirism is a curse, however some of the traits that are gained may make one rethink if its really that terrible.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Charisma, Dexterity and Strength scores all increase by 2.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Age:</span> Vampires are Immortal, and do not age a day from when they were turned.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Alignment:</span> Becoming a Vampire is either by choice, or accident. A pious man seeking immortality, or an Elf desiring power to rule are some scenarios that can turn one into a Vampire. Or even a Half-Orc being in the wrong place at the wrong time could turn into a night of new found immortality. No matter how one came to be a Vampire, after some time of dwelling in darkness, evil might be the easiest thing to cling to. However, with strong enough will, one could maintain their values and remain the alignment they had in life.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Size:</span> There is no change in your size once becoming a Vampire.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Speed:</span> Your base walking speed is 45</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Languages:</span> You know the languages known in life.</p>\r\n\r\n            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Superior Darkvision:</span> You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can discern color in darkness.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Undead:</span> You are an Undead creature. Necrotic damage does not affect you. You also need 1 ration of blood every 5 days or your body begins to cease functioning. On the 5th day without blood, the Vampire is unable to heal and takes 1d20 of damage every hour and rolls disadvantage on everything. If the Vampire drops to 0 hit points from this, they are paralyzed until force fed blood. Then they regain 1d20 hit points taken from loss of blood and no longer roll disadvantage.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Compulsion:</span> The Vampire can control the mind of another simply through eye contact. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled by the Vampire. Compelled beings usually follow the instructions given to them to the best of their ability, and are willing subjects to the Vampire's bite attack. Some species of naturally occurring herbs can prevent compulsion.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Sunlight Hypersensitivity:</span> Because of the corpse a vampire resides in, sunlight burns any skin it comes into contact with. A Vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Forbiddance:</span> Luckily for every living creature, a Vampire can not enter a residence without an invitation from the owner.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Stake to the Heart:</span> If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the Vampires heart, the Vampire begins to desiccate and is paralyzed until the stake is removed. However, if this happens when a Vampire is at 0 hit points, they spontaneously combust and are destroyed. The soul of the Vampire leaves the burning corpse and seeks its final resting place. It may be captured and used as a component to a spell.</p>\r\n\r\n            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n\r\n            <h4>Vampiric Feats</h4>\r\n            <p>Vampires learn these as they become better acquainted with their new Immortal form. </p>\r\n\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Bite:</span> At 1st level, you can use your sharp fangs to inflict damage. One willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the Vampire, incapacitated, or restrained. Hit: 2d6+DEX piercing damage plus 2d8 necrotic damage. The amount of bite damage increases as you gain levels. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the Vampire regains hit points equal to that. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. You may use your bonus action to drink their blood dealing 1d12 damage. This also satisfies your need for blood. A humanoid slain after being bitten, and then buried in the ground will rise the following night as a Vampire Spawn.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Healing Blood:</span> Starting at 5th level, your immortal nature is imbedded in your blood, making your Vampire blood able to heal any living creature by 1d20+CON.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Blood Manipulation:</span> When you reach 7th level, your knowledge of organic processes and experience with your victims life blood grants you the dark magic ability to siphon out your targets blood (if they have an open wound) and mold it into any solid construct. This action deals 1d12 damage. The construct becomes liquid if the target dies.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Creatures of the Night:</span> Beginning at 9th level, your relation to dark creatures gives you power over weaker creatures of the night. As an action you can call 2d4 swarms of Bats or Rats at night time, or 3d6 wolves if outside. The creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds and obey your spoken commands.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Legendary Resistance (3/day):</span> When you reach 12th level, because you are king of the night, if a you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Multiattack:</span> At 15th level, the deadly and frightening reputation that proceeds you gives you the ability to make two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Flight:</span> At 19th level, you gain the ability to Fly. No creature is safe anymore.
