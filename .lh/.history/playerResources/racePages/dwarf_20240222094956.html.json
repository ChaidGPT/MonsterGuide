class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Constitution score increases by 2.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Age:</span> Dwarves mature at the sam e rate as humans, but they’re considered\r\n                young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Alignment:</span> Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a\r\n                well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that\r\n                everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a just order.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Size:</span> Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150\r\n                pounds. Your size is Medium.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Speed:</span> Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by\r\n                wearing heavy armor.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Darkvision:</span> Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in\r\n                dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and\r\n                in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Dwarven Resilience:</span> You have advantage on saving throws against poison,\r\n                and you have resistance against poison damage.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Dwarven Combat Training:</span> You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe,\r\n                throwing hammer, and warhammer.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Tools Proficiency:</span> You gain proficiency with the artisan’s tools of your\r\n                choice: smith’s tools, brewers' supplies, or mason’s tools.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Stonecunning:</span> Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to\r\n                the origin of stonework, you are considered proficient in the History skill and add double your\r\n                proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Languages:</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is\r\n                full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other\r\n                language a dwarf might speak.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Subrace:</span> Two main subraces of dwarves populate the worlds of D&D: hill\r\n                dwarves and mountain dwarves.</p>\r\n\r\n            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n            <h6>Hill Dwarf</h6>\r\n            <p>As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, and remarkable resilience. The gold dwarves of\r\n                Faerun in their mighty southern kingdom are hill dwarves, as are the exiled Neidar and the debased Klar\r\n                of Krynn in the Dragonlance setting.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Dwarven Toughness:</span> Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases\r\n                by 1 every time you gain a level.</p>\r\n\r\n            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n            <h6>Mountain Dwarf</h6>\r\n            <p>As a mountain dwarf, you're strong and hardy, accustomed to a difficult life in rugged terrain. You’re\r\n                probably on the tall side (for a dwarf), and tend toward lighter coloration. The shield dwarves of\r\n                northern Faerun, as well as the ruling Hylar clan and the noble Daewar clan of Dragonlance, are mountain\r\n                dwarves.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Strength score increases by 2.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Dwarven Armor Training:</span> You have proficiency with light and medium armor.\r\n            </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <!-- End collapseStats -->\r\n        <!-- Start collapseLore -->\r\n        <div class=\"collapse rounded\" id=\"collapseLore\">\r\n            <div class=\"dropdown\">\r\n                <button class=\"btn btn-secondary dropdown-toggle\" type=\"button\" id=\"dropdownMenuButton\"\r\n                    data-toggle=\"dropdown\" aria-haspopup=\"true\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\r\n                    Lore\r\n                </button>\r\n                <div class=\"dropdown-menu\" aria-labelledby=\"dropdownMenuButton\">\r\n                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#shortAndStout\">Short and Stout</a>\r\n                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#longMemoryLongGrudges\">Long Memory, Long Grudges</a>\r\n                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#clansAndKingdoms\">Clans and Kingdoms</a>\r\n                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#godsGoldAndClan\">Gods, Gold, and Clan</a>\r\n                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#dwarfNames\">Dwarf Names</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n            <div id=\"shortAndStout\">\r\n                <h5>Short and Stout</h5>\r\n                <p>Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though\r\n                    they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a\r\n                    human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any\r\n                    of the larger folk.</p>\r\n                <p>Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are\r\n                    light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is\r\n                    usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their\r\n                    beards highly and groom them carefully.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n            <div id=\"longMemoryLongGrudges\">\r\n                <h5>Long Memory, Long Grudges</h5>\r\n                <p>Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often rem em ber a very\r\n                    different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of\r\n                    the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the\r\n                    fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a\r\n                    perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.</p>\r\n                <p>Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with\r\n                    stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their\r\n                    ancestry back to the founding o f their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and\r\n                    don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the\r\n                    dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the\r\n                    forge.</p>\r\n                <p>Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to\r\n                    the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense o f justice, and they are slow to forget\r\n                    wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf’s entire clan, so\r\n                    what begins as one dwarf’s hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n            <div id=\"clansAndKingdoms\">\r\n                <h5>Clans and Kingdoms</h5>\r\n                <p>Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals\r\n                    and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry,\r\n                    and in some dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can’t find in their\r\n                    mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings\r\n                    frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are\r\n                    welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them.</p>\r\n                <p>The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves\r\n                    who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan identities and affiliations, recognize\r\n                    related dwarves, and invoke their ancestors’ names in oaths and curses. To be clanless is the worst\r\n                    fate that can befall a dwarf.</p>\r\n                <p>Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially weapon smiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some\r\n                    become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after for their courage and loyalty.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n            <div id=\"godsGoldAndClan\">\r\n                <h5>Gods, Gold, and Clan</h5>\r\n                <p>Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a desire for treasure—for its own\r\n                    sake, for a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help others. Other dwarves are\r\n                    driven by the com m and or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to bring\r\n                    glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek\r\n                    to restore a clan’s lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place\r\n                    within the clan after having been exiled.
