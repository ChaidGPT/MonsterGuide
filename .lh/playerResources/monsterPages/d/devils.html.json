The\r\n-                    Prince of Demons has two baleful baboon heads, both of them mad.

When battle breaks out- or if she has a reason to\r\n-                    remind her followers to fear her- Lolth's lower body transforms into that of a huge demonic spider,\r\n-                    whose spike-tipped legs and mandibles tear foes apart.</p>\r\n-\r\n-                <h6>Orcus</h6>\r\n-                <p>Known as the Demon Prince of Undeath and the Blood Lord, the demon lord Orcus is worshiped by the\r\n-                    undead and by living creatures that channel the power of undeath.

His sore-ridden body stinks of disease, but his decaying\r\n-                    head and glowing red eyes are as a creature already dead. Great black bat wings sprout from his\r\n-                    back, stirring reeking air as he moves.</p>\r\n-                <p>Orcus wields a malevolent artifact known as the Wand of Orcus, a mace-like rod of obsidian topped by\r\n-                    a humanoid skull.

Gnolls are his mortal instruments, and he drives them to ever-greater\r\n-                    atrocities in his name. Delighting in sorrow and hopelessness, the Gnoll Lord yearns to turn the\r\n-                    world into a wasteland in which the last surviving gnolls tear each other apart for the right to\r\n-                    feast upon the dead.</p>\r\n-                <p>Yeenoghu appears as a huge, scarred gnoll with a spiky crest of black spines, and eyes that burn with\r\n-                    emerald flame. His armor is a patchwork of shields and breastplates claimed from fallen foes, and\r\n-                    decorated by those foes' flayed skins. Yeenoghu can summon a triple flail he calls the Butcher,\r\n-                    which he wields to deadly effect or wills to fly independently into battle as he tears foes apart\r\n-                    with teeth and claws.</p>\r\n-\r\n-                <h6>Other Demon Lords</h6>\r\n-                <p>No one knows the full number of demon lords that rage in the Abyss. Given the infinite depths of that\r\n-                    plane, powerful demons constantly rise to become demon lords, then fall almost as quickly.

This singular ambition \r\n+                    is strongest among the archdevils whom Asmodeus \r\n+                    appoints to rule the nine layers of the Nine Hells. These \r\n+                    high-ranking fiends are the only devils to ever sample \r\n+                    true power, which they crave like the sweetest ambrosia.</p>\r\n+            </div>\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <div id=\"3\">\r\n+                <h5>Dark Dealers and Soul Mongers</h5>\r\n+                <p>Devils are confined \r\n+                    to the Lower Planes, but they can travel beyond those \r\n+                    planes by way of portals or powerful summoning magic. \r\n+                    They love to strike bargains with mortals seeking to \r\n+                    gain some benefit or prize, but a mortal making such \r\n+                    a bargain must be wary. Devils are crafty negotiators \r\n+                    and positively ruthless at enforcing the terms of an \r\n+                    agreement. Moreover, a contract with even the lowliest \r\n+                    devil is enforced by Asmodeus's will. Any mortal \r\n+                    creature that breaks such a contract instantly forfeits its \r\n+                    soul, which is spirited away to the Nine Hells.</p>\r\n+                <p>To own a creature's soul is to have absolute control \r\n+                    over that creature, and most devils accept no other \r\n+                    currency in exchange for the fiendish power and boons \r\n+                    they can provide. A soul is usually forfeited when a \r\n+                    mortal dies naturally, for devils are immortal and can \r\n+                    wait years for a contract to play out. If a contract allows \r\n+                    a devil to claim a mortal's soul before death, it can \r\n+                    instantly return to the Nine Hells with the soul in its \r\n+                    possession. Only divine intervention can release a soul \r\n+                    after a devil has claimed it.</p>\r\n+            </div>\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <div id=\"4\">\r\n+                <h5>The Infernal Hierarch</h5>\r\n+                <p>The Nine Hells has a rigid hierarchy that defines every \r\n+                    aspect of its society.

Devils are crafty negotiators \r\n-                    and positively ruthless at enforcing the terms of an \r\n-                    agreement. Moreover, a contract with even the lowliest \r\n-                    devil is enforced by Asmodeus's will. Any mortal \r\n-                    creature that breaks such a contract instantly forfeits its \r\n-                    soul, which is spirited away to the Nine Hells.</p>\r\n-                <p>To own a creature's soul is to have absolute control \r\n-                    over that creature, and most devils accept no other \r\n-                    currency in exchange for the fiendish power and boons \r\n-                    they can provide. A soul is usually forfeited when a \r\n-                    mortal dies naturally, for devils are immortal and can \r\n-                    wait years for a contract to play out. If a contract allows \r\n-                    a devil to claim a mortal's soul before death, it can \r\n-                    instantly return to the Nine Hells with the soul in its \r\n-                    possession.

If a contract allows a\r\n+            devil to claim a mortal's soul before death, it can instantly return\r\n+            to the Nine Hells with the soul in its possession. Only divine\r\n+            intervention can release a soul after a devil has claimed it.\r\n+          </p>\r\n+        </div>\r\n+        <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+        <div id=\"4\">\r\n+          <h5>The Infernal Hierarch</h5>\r\n+          <p>\r\n+            The Nine Hells has a rigid hierarchy that defines every aspect of\r\n+            its society. Asmodeus is the supreme ruler of all devils, and the\r\n+            only creature in the Nine Hells with the powers of a lesser god.\r\n+            Worshiped as such in the Material Plane, Asmodeus inspires the evil\r\n+            humanoid cults that take his name. In the Nine Hells, he commands\r\n+            scores of pit fiend generals, which in turn command legions of\r\n+            subordinates.\r\n+          </p>\r\n+          <p>\r\n+            A supreme tyrant, a brilliant deceiver, and a master of subtlety,\r\n+            Asmodeus protects his throne by keeping his friends close and his\r\n+            enemies closer. He delegates most matters of rulership to the pit\r\n+            fiends and lesser arch devils that make up the infernal bureaucracy\r\n+            of the Nine Hells, even as he knows that those powerful devils\r\n+            conspire to usurp the Throne of Baa tor from which he rules.\r\n+            Asmodeus appoints archdevils, and he can strip any member of the\r\n+            infernal hierarchy of rank and status as he likes.\r\n+          </p>\r\n+          <p>\r\n+            If it dies outside the Nine Hells, a devil disappears in a cloud of\r\n+            sulfurous smoke or dissolves into a pool of ichor, instantly\r\n+            returning to its home layer, where it reforms at full strength.\r\n+            Devils that die in the Nine Hells are destroyed forever- a fate that\r\n+            even Asmodeus fears.\r\n+          </p>\r\n+          <p>\r\n+            <span class=\"bold-text\">Archdevils:</span> The archdevils include\r\n+            all the current and deposed rulers of the Nine Hells (see the Layers\r\n+            and Lords of the Nine Hells table), as well as the dukes and\r\n+            duchesses that make up their courts, attend them as advisers, and\r\n+            hope to supplant them. Every archdevil is a unique being with an\r\n+            appearance that reflects its particular evil nature.\r\n+          </p>\r\n+          <p>\r\n+            <span class=\"bold-text\">Greater Devils:</span> The greater devils\r\n+            include the pit fiends, erinyes, horned devils, and ice devils that\r\n+            command lesser devils and attend the archdevils\r\n+          </p>\r\n+          <p>\r\n+            <span class=\"bold-text\">Lesser Devils:</span> The lesser devils\r\n+            include numerous strains of fiends, including imps, chain devils,\r\n+            spined devils, bearded devils, barbed devils, and bone devils.\r\n+          </p>\r\n+          <p>\r\n+            <span class=\"bold-text\">Lemures:</span> The lowest form of devil,\r\n+            lemures are the twisted and tormented souls of evil and corrupted\r\n+            mortals. A lemure killed in the Nine Hells is only permanently\r\n+            destroyed if it is killed with a blessed weapon or if its shapeless\r\n+            corpse is splashed with holy water before it can return to life.\r\n+          </p>\r\n+          <p>\r\n+            <span class=\"bold-text\">Promotion and Demotion:</span> When the soul\r\n+            of an evil mortal sinks into the Nine Hells, it takes on the\r\n+            physical form of a wretched lemure. Archdevils and greater devils\r\n+            have the power to promote lemures to lesser devils. Archdevils can\r\n+            promote lesser devils to greater devils, and Asmodeus alone can\r\n+            promote a greater devil to archdevil status. This diabolic promotion\r\n+            invokes a brief, painful transformation, with the devil's memories\r\n+            passing intact from one form to the next.\r\n+          </p>\r\n+          <p>\r\n+            Low-level promotions are typically based on need, such as when a pit\r\n+            fiend transforms lemures into imps to gain invisible spies under its\r\n+            command. High-level promotions are almost always based on merit,\r\n+            such as when a bone devil that distinguishes itself in battle is\r\n+            transformed into a horned devil by the archdevil it serves. A devil\r\n+            is seldom promoted more than one step at a time in the hierarchy of\r\n+            infernal forms.\r\n+          </p>\r\n+        </div>\r\n+        <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+        <div id=\"5\">\r\n+          <h5>The Nine Hells</h5>\r\n+          <p></p>\r\n+        </div>\r\n+        <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+        <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary\" onclick=\"goToTop()\">\r\n+          Back to Top\r\n+        </button>\r\n+      </div>\r\n     </div>\r\n     <!-- End collapseLore -->\r\n \r\n     <footer class=\"page-footer font-small blue fixed-bottom\">\r\n-        <p>&copy; Chad Oswald | <a href=\"mailto:chadloswald@gmail.com\">chadloswald@gmail.com</a></p>\r\n+      <p>\r\n+        &copy; Chad Oswald |\r\n+        <a href=\"mailto:chadloswald@gmail.com\">chadloswald@gmail.com</a>\r\n+      </p>\r\n     </footer>\r\n \r\n-    <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js\"\r\n-        integrity=\"sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo\"\r\n-        crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\r\n-    <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/popper.js@1.14.7/dist/umd/popper.min.js\"\r\n-        integrity=\"sha384-UO2eT0CpHqdSJQ6hJty5KVphtPhzWj9WO1clHTMGa3JDZwrnQq4sF86dIHNDz0W1\"\r\n-        crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\r\n-    <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.3.1/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js\"\r\n-        integrity=\"sha384-JjSmVgyd0p3pXB1rRibZUAYoIIy6OrQ6VrjIEaFf/nJGzIxFDsf4x0xIM+B07jRM\"\r\n-        crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\r\n+    <script\r\n+      src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js\"\r\n+      integrity=\"sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo\"\r\n+      crossorigin=\"anonymous\"\r\n+    ></script>\r\n+    <script\r\n+      src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/popper.js@1.14.7/dist/umd/popper.min.js\"\r\n+      integrity=\"sha384-UO2eT0CpHqdSJQ6hJty5KVphtPhzWj9WO1clHTMGa3JDZwrnQq4sF86dIHNDz0W1\"\r\n+      crossorigin=\"anonymous\"\r\n+    ></script>\r\n+    <script\r\n+      src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.3.1/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js\"\r\n+      integrity=\"sha384-JjSmVgyd0p3pXB1rRibZUAYoIIy6OrQ6VrjIEaFf/nJGzIxFDsf4x0xIM+B07jRM\"\r\n+      crossorigin=\"anonymous\"\r\n+    ></script>\r\n     <script src=\"../../../scriptMon.js\"></script>\r\n-</body>\r\n-\r\n-</html>\n+  </body>\r\n+</html>\r\n"

If a\r\n                    demon possesses a creature. and the object binding the demon is destroyed, the possession lasts\r\n                    until powerful magic is used to drive the demonic spirit out of its host.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n            <div id=\"demonLords\">\r\n                <h5>Demon Lords</h5>\r\n                <p>The chaotic power of the Abyss rewards demons of particular ruthlessness and ingenuity with a dark.\r\n                    blessing, transforming them into unique fiends whose power can rival the gods. These demon lords\r\n                    rule through cunning or brute force, hoping to one day claim the prize of absolute control over all\r\n                    the Abyss.</p>\r\n                <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Reward for Outsiders:</span> Although most demon lords rise up from the vast\r\n                    and uncountable mobs of demons rampaging across the Abyss, the plane also rewards outsiders that\r\n                    conquer any of its infinite layers. The elven goddess Lolth became a demon lord after Corellon\r\n                    Larethian cast her into the Abyss for betraying elvenkind. Sages claim that the Dark Prince Graz'zt\r\n                    originated on some other plane before stealing his abyssal title from another long-forgotten demon\r\n                    lord.</p>\r\n                <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Power and Control:</span> The greatest sign of a demon lord's power is its\r\n                    ability to reshape an abyssal realm. A layer of the Abyss controlled by a demon lord becomes a\r\n                    twisted reflection of that fiend's vile personality, and demon lords seldom leave their realms for\r\n                    fear of allowing another creature to reshape and seize it.</p>\r\n                <p>As with other demons, a demon lord that dies on another plane has its essence return to the Abyss,\r\n                    where it reforms into a new body. Likewise, a demon lord that dies in the Abyss is permanently\r\n                    destroyed. Most demon lords keep a portion of their essence safely stored away to prevent such a\r\n                    fate.</p>\r\n\r\n                <h6>Baphomet</h6>\r\n                <p>The demon lord Baphomet, also known as the Horned King and the Prince of Beasts, rules over minotaurs\r\n                    and other savage creatures. If he had his way, civilization would crumble and all races would\r\n                    embrace their base animal savagery.</p>\r\n                <p>The Prince of Beasts appears as a huge, black-furred minotaur with iron horns, red eyes, and a\r\n                    blood-soaked mouth. His iron crown is topped with the rotting heads of his enemies, while his dark\r\n                    armor is set with spikes and skull-like serrations. He carries a huge glaive named Heartcleaver, but\r\n                    often hurls it into the fray so as to face his enemies with horns and hooves.</p>\r\n\r\n                <h6>Demogorgon</h6>\r\n                <p>The Sibilant Beast and the self-styled Prince of Demons, Demogorgon yearns for nothing less than\r\n                    undoing the order of the multiverse. An insane assemblage of features and drives, the Prince of\r\n                    Demons inspires fear and hatred among other demons and demon lords.</p>\r\n                <p>Demogorgon towers three times the height of a human, his body as sinuous as a snake's and as powerful\r\n                    as a great ape's. Suckered tentacles take the place of his arms. His saurian lower torso ends in\r\n                    webbed and clawed feet, and a forked tail whose whip-like tips are armed with cruel blades. The\r\n                    Prince of Demons has two baleful baboon heads, both of them mad. It is only the conflict between the\r\n                    two halves of his dual nature that keeps the demon lord's ambitions in check.</p>\r\n\r\n                <h6>Graz'zt</h6>\r\n                <p>The demon lord Graz'zt appears as a darkly handsome figure nearly nine feet tall. Those who refer to\r\n                    the Dark Prince as the most humanoid of the demon lords vastly underestimate the capacity for evil\r\n                    in his scheming heart.</p>\r\n                <p>Graz'zt is a striking physical specimen, whose demonic nature shows in his ebon skin, pointed ears,\r\n                    yellow fangs, crown of horns, and six-fingered hands. He delights in finery, pageantry, and sating\r\n                    his decadent desires with subjects and consorts alike, among whom incubi and succubi are often his\r\n                    favorites.</p>\r\n\r\n                <h6>Juiblex</h6>\r\n                <p>The demon lord of slimes and oozes, Juiblex is a stew of noxious fluids that lurks in the abyssal\r\n                    depths. The wretched Faceless Lord cares nothing for cultists or mortal servants, and its sole\r\n                    desire is to turn all creatures into formless copies of its horrid self.</p>\r\n                <p>In its resting state, Juiblex spreads out in a noxious mass, bubbling and filling the air with a\r\n                    profound stench. On the rare occasions when creatures confront the demon lord, Juiblex draws itself\r\n                    up into a shuddering cone of slime striated with veins of black and green. Baleful red eyes swim\r\n                    within its gelatinous body, while dripping pseudopods of ooze lash out hungrily at any creature they\r\n                    can reach.</p>\r\n\r\n                <h6>Lolth</h6>\r\n                <p>The Demon Queen of Spiders is the evil matron of the drow. Her every thought is touched by malice,\r\n                    and the depth of her viciousness can surprise even her most faithful priestesses. She directs her\r\n                    faithful while she weaves plots across the worlds of the Material Plane, looking forward to the time\r\n                    when her drow followers bring those worlds under her control.</p>\r\n                <p>Lolth appears as a lithe, imperious drow matriarch when she manifests to her followers in the mortal\r\n                    realm, which she does with unusual frequency. When battle breaks out- or if she has a reason to\r\n                    remind her followers to fear her- Lolth's lower body transforms into that of a huge demonic spider,\r\n                    whose spike-tipped legs and mandibles tear foes apart.</p>\r\n\r\n                <h6>Orcus</h6>\r\n                <p>Known as the Demon Prince of Undeath and the Blood Lord, the demon lord Orcus is worshiped by the\r\n                    undead and by living creatures that channel the power of undeath. A brooding and nihilistic entity,\r\n                    Orcus yearns to make the multiverse a place of death and darkness, forever unchanging except by his\r\n                    will.</p>\r\n                <p>The Demon Prince of Undeath l's a foul and corpulent creature, with a humanoid torso, powerful goat\r\n                    legs, and the desiccated head of a ram. His sore-ridden body stinks of disease, but his decaying\r\n                    head and glowing red eyes are as a creature already dead. Great black bat wings sprout from his\r\n                    back, stirring reeking air as he moves.</p>\r\n                <p>Orcus wields a malevolent artifact known as the Wand of Orcus, a mace-like rod of obsidian topped by\r\n                    a humanoid skull. He surrounds himself with undead, and living creatures not under his control are\r\n                    anathema to him.</p>\r\n\r\n                <h6>Yeenoghu</h6>\r\n                <p>Known as the Gnoll Lord and the Beast of Butchery, the demon lord Yeenoghu hungers for slaughter and\r\n                    senseless destruction. Gnolls are his mortal instruments, and he drives them to ever-greater\r\n                    atrocities in his name. Delighting in sorrow and hopelessness, the Gnoll Lord yearns to turn the\r\n                    world into a wasteland in which the last surviving gnolls tear each other apart for the right to\r\n                    feast upon the dead.</p>\r\n                <p>Yeenoghu appears as a huge, scarred gnoll with a spiky crest of black spines, and eyes that burn with\r\n                    emerald flame. His armor is a patchwork of shields and breastplates claimed from fallen foes, and\r\n                    decorated by those foes' flayed skins. Yeenoghu can summon a triple flail he calls the Butcher,\r\n                    which he wields to deadly effect or wills to fly independently into battle as he tears foes apart\r\n                    with teeth and claws.</p>\r\n\r\n                <h6>Other Demon Lords</h6>\r\n                <p>No one knows the full number of demon lords that rage in the Abyss. Given the infinite depths of that\r\n                    plane, powerful demons constantly rise to become demon lords, then fall almost as quickly. Among the\r\n                    demon lords whose power has endured long enough for demonologists to name them are Fraz-Urb'luu, the\r\n                    Prince of Deception; Kostchtchie, the Prince of Wrath; Pazuzu, Prince of the Lower Aerial Kingdoms;\r\n                    and Zuggtmoy, Lady of Fungi.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n            <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary\" onclick=\"goToTop()\">Back to Top</button>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <!-- End collapseLore -->\r\n\r\n    <footer class=\"page-footer font-small blue fixed-bottom\">\r\n        <p>&copy; Chad Oswald | <a href=\"mailto:chadloswald@gmail.com\">chadloswald@gmail.com</a></p>\r\n    </footer>\r\n\r\n    <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js\"\r\n        integrity=\"sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo\"\r\n        crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\r\n    <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/popper.js@1.14.7/dist/umd/popper.min.js\"\r\n        integrity=\"sha384-UO2eT0CpHqdSJQ6hJty5KVphtPhzWj9WO1clHTMGa3JDZwrnQq4sF86dIHNDz0W1\"\r\n        crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\r\n    <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.3.1/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js\"\r\n        integrity=\"sha384-JjSmVgyd0p3pXB1rRibZUAYoIIy6OrQ6VrjIEaFf/nJGzIxFDsf4x0xIM+B07jRM\"\r\n        crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\r\n    <script src=\"../../../scriptMon.js\"></script>\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>"
