On average, they live about 350 years.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Alignment:</span> Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a\r\n+                well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that\r\n+                everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a just order.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Size:</span> Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150\r\n+                pounds. Your size is Medium.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Speed:</span> Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by\r\n+                wearing heavy armor.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Darkvision:</span> Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in\r\n+                dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and\r\n+                in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Dwarven Resilience:</span> You have advantage on saving throws against poison,\r\n+                and you have resistance against poison damage.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Dwarven Combat Training:</span> You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe,\r\n+                throwing hammer, and warhammer.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Tools Proficiency:</span> You gain proficiency with the artisan’s tools of your\r\n+                choice: smith’s tools, brewers' supplies, or mason’s tools.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Stonecunning:</span> Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to\r\n+                the origin of stonework, you are considered proficient in the History skill and add double your\r\n+                proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Languages:</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish.

The shield dwarves of\r\n+                northern Faerun, as well as the ruling Hylar clan and the noble Daewar clan of Dragonlance, are mountain\r\n+                dwarves.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Strength score increases by 2.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Dwarven Armor Training:</span> You have proficiency with light and medium armor.\r\n+            </p>\r\n+        </div>\r\n+        <!-- End collapseStats -->\r\n+        <!-- Start collapseLore -->\r\n+        <div class=\"collapse\" id=\"collapseLore\">\r\n+            <div class=\"dropdown\">\r\n+                <button class=\"btn btn-secondary dropdown-toggle\" type=\"button\" id=\"dropdownMenuButton\"\r\n+                    data-toggle=\"dropdown\" aria-haspopup=\"true\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\r\n+                    Lore\r\n+                </button>\r\n+                <div class=\"dropdown-menu\" aria-labelledby=\"dropdownMenuButton\">\r\n+                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#shortAndStout\">Short and Stout</a>\r\n+                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#longMemoryLongGrudges\">Long Memory, Long Grudges</a>\r\n+                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#clansAndKingdoms\">Clans and Kingdoms</a>\r\n+                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#godsGoldAndClan\">Gods, Gold, and Clan</a>\r\n+                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#dwarfNames\">Dwarf Names</a>\r\n+                </div>\r\n+            </div>\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <div id=\"shortAndStout\">\r\n+                <h5>Short and Stout</h5>\r\n+                <p>Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though\r\n+                    they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a\r\n+                    human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any\r\n+                    of the larger folk.</p>\r\n+                <p>Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are\r\n+                    light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is\r\n+                    usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their\r\n+                    beards highly and groom them carefully.</p>\r\n+            </div>\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <div id=\"longMemoryLongGrudges\">\r\n+                <h5>Long Memory, Long Grudges</h5>\r\n+                <p>Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often rem em ber a very\r\n+                    different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of\r\n+                    the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the\r\n+                    fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a\r\n+                    perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.</p>\r\n+                <p>Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with\r\n+                    stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their\r\n+                    ancestry back to the founding o f their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and\r\n+                    don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the\r\n+                    dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the\r\n+                    forge.</p>\r\n+                <p>Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to\r\n+                    the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense o f justice, and they are slow to forget\r\n+                    wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf’s entire clan, so\r\n+                    what begins as one dwarf’s hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.</p>\r\n+            </div>\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <div id=\"clansAndKingdoms\">\r\n+                <h5>Clans and Kingdoms</h5>\r\n+                <p>Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals\r\n+                    and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry,\r\n+                    and in some dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can’t find in their\r\n+                    mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings\r\n+                    frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are\r\n+                    welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them.</p>\r\n+                <p>The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves\r\n+                    who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan identities and affiliations, recognize\r\n+                    related dwarves, and invoke their ancestors’ names in oaths and curses. To be clanless is the worst\r\n+                    fate that can befall a dwarf.</p>\r\n+                <p>Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially weapon smiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some\r\n+                    become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after for their courage and loyalty.</p>\r\n+            </div>\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <div id=\"godsGoldAndClan\">\r\n+                <h5>Gods, Gold, and Clan</h5>\r\n+                <p>Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a desire for treasure—for its own\r\n+                    sake, for a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help others. Other dwarves are\r\n+                    driven by the com m and or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to bring\r\n+                    glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek\r\n+                    to restore a clan’s lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place\r\n+                    within the clan after having been exiled.

For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of\r\n+                    the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the\r\n+                    fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a\r\n+                    perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.</p>\r\n+                <p>Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with\r\n+                    stoic endurance and little change.

Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the\r\n+                    dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the\r\n+                    forge.</p>\r\n+                <p>Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to\r\n+                    the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense o f justice, and they are slow to forget\r\n+                    wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf’s entire clan, so\r\n+                    what begins as one dwarf’s hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.</p>\r\n+            </div>\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <div id=\"clansAndKingdoms\">\r\n+                <h5>Clans and Kingdoms</h5>\r\n+                <p>Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals\r\n+                    and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry,\r\n+                    and in some dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can’t find in their\r\n+                    mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings\r\n+                    frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are\r\n+                    welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them.</p>\r\n+                <p>The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing.

An elf typically claim s adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Alignment:</span> Elves love freedom , variety, and sel-fexpression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. The drow are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Size:</span> Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Speed:</span> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Darkvision:</span> Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Keen Senses:</span> You have proficiency in the Perception skill.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Fey Ancestry:</span> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Trance:</span> Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Languages:</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Subrace:</span> Ancient divides among the elven people resulted in three main subraces: high elves, wood elves, and dark elves, who are commonly called drow. Choose one of these subraces. In some worlds, these subraces are divided still further (such as the sun elves and moon elves of the Forgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can choose a narrower subrace.</p>\r\n+\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <h6>High Elf</h6>\r\n+            <p>As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds of D&D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type (which includes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk. the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.</p>\r\n+            <p>The sun elves of Faerun (also called gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with gold.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Intelligence score increases by 2.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Elf Weapon Training:</span> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Cantrip:</span> You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list.

Though\r\n+                    they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a\r\n+                    human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any\r\n+                    of the larger folk.</p>\r\n+                <p>Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are\r\n+                    light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is\r\n+                    usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their\r\n+                    beards highly and groom them carefully.</p>\r\n+            </div>\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <div id=\"longMemoryLongGrudges\">\r\n+                <h5>Long Memory, Long Grudges</h5>\r\n+                <p>Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often rem em ber a very\r\n+                    different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of\r\n+                    the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the\r\n+                    fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a\r\n+                    perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.</p>\r\n+                <p>Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with\r\n+                    stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their\r\n+                    ancestry back to the founding o f their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and\r\n+                    don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the\r\n+                    dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the\r\n+                    forge.</p>\r\n+                <p>Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to\r\n+                    the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense o f justice, and they are slow to forget\r\n+                    wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf’s entire clan, so\r\n+                    what begins as one dwarf’s hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.</p>\r\n+            </div>\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <div id=\"clansAndKingdoms\">\r\n+                <h5>Clans and Kingdoms</h5>\r\n+                <p>Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals\r\n+                    and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry,\r\n+                    and in some dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can’t find in their\r\n+                    mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings\r\n+                    frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are\r\n+                    welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them.</p>\r\n+                <p>The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves\r\n+                    who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan identities and affiliations, recognize\r\n+                    related dwarves, and invoke their ancestors’ names in oaths and curses. To be clanless is the worst\r\n+                    fate that can befall a dwarf.</p>\r\n+                <p>Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially weapon smiths, armorers, and jewelers.

Other dwarves are\r\n+                    driven by the com m and or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to bring\r\n+                    glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek\r\n+                    to restore a clan’s lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place\r\n+                    within the clan after having been exiled.

An elf typically claim s adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Alignment:</span> Elves love freedom , variety, and sel-fexpression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. The drow are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Size:</span> Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Speed:</span> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Darkvision:</span> Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Keen Senses:</span> You have proficiency in the Perception skill.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Fey Ancestry:</span> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Trance:</span> Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Languages:</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Subrace:</span> Ancient divides among the elven people resulted in three main subraces: high elves, wood elves, and dark elves, who are commonly called drow. Choose one of these subraces. In some worlds, these subraces are divided still further (such as the sun elves and moon elves of the Forgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can choose a narrower subrace.</p>\r\n+\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <h6>High Elf</h6>\r\n+            <p>As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds of D&D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type (which includes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk. the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.</p>\r\n+            <p>The sun elves of Faerun (also called gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with gold.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Intelligence score increases by 2.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Elf Weapon Training:</span> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Cantrip:</span> You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Extra Language:</span> You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.</p>\r\n+\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <h6>Wood Elf</h6>\r\n+            <p>As a wood elf, you have keen senses and intuition, and your fleet feet carry you quickly and stealthily through your native forests. This category includes the wild elves (grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of Dragonlance, as well as the races called wood elves in Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms. In Faerun, wood elves (also called wild elves, green elves, or forest elves) are reclusive and distrusting of non-elves.</p>\r\n+            <p>Wood elves’ skin tends to be copperish in hue, sometimes with traces of green. Their hair tends toward browns and blacks, but it is occasionally blond or copper-colored. Their eyes are green, brown, or hazel.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> </p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Elf Weapon Training:</span> </p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Fleet of Foot:</span> </p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Mask of the Wild:</span> </p>\r\n+\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <h6>Dark Elf (Drow)</h6>\r\n+            <p></p>\r\n+            <p></p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> </p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Superior Darkvision:</span> </p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Sunlight Sensitivity:</span> </p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Drow Magic:</span> </p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Drow Weapon Training:</span> </p>\r\n+\r\n+            \r\n+        </div>\r\n+        <!-- End collapseStats -->\r\n+        <!-- Start collapseLore -->\r\n+        <div class=\"collapse\" id=\"collapseLore\">\r\n+            <div class=\"dropdown\">\r\n+                <button class=\"btn btn-secondary dropdown-toggle\" type=\"button\" id=\"dropdownMenuButton\"\r\n+                    data-toggle=\"dropdown\" aria-haspopup=\"true\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\r\n+                    Lore\r\n+                </button>\r\n+                <div class=\"dropdown-menu\" aria-labelledby=\"dropdownMenuButton\">\r\n+                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#shortAndStout\">Short and Stout</a>\r\n+                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#longMemoryLongGrudges\">Long Memory, Long Grudges</a>\r\n+                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#clansAndKingdoms\">Clans and Kingdoms</a>\r\n+                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#godsGoldAndClan\">Gods, Gold, and Clan</a>\r\n+                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#dwarfNames\">Dwarf Names</a>\r\n+                </div>\r\n+            </div>\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <div id=\"shortAndStout\">\r\n+                <h5>Short and Stout</h5>\r\n+                <p>Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though\r\n+                    they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a\r\n+                    human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any\r\n+                    of the larger folk.</p>\r\n+                <p>Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are\r\n+                    light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is\r\n+                    usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their\r\n+                    beards highly and groom them carefully.</p>\r\n+            </div>\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <div id=\"longMemoryLongGrudges\">\r\n+                <h5>Long Memory, Long Grudges</h5>\r\n+                <p>Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often rem em ber a very\r\n+                    different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of\r\n+                    the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the\r\n+                    fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a\r\n+                    perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.</p>\r\n+                <p>Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with\r\n+                    stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their\r\n+                    ancestry back to the founding o f their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and\r\n+                    don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the\r\n+                    dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the\r\n+                    forge.</p>\r\n+                <p>Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to\r\n+                    the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense o f justice, and they are slow to forget\r\n+                    wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf’s entire clan, so\r\n+                    what begins as one dwarf’s hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.</p>\r\n+            </div>\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <div id=\"clansAndKingdoms\">\r\n+                <h5>Clans and Kingdoms</h5>\r\n+                <p>Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals\r\n+                    and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry,\r\n+                    and in some dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can’t find in their\r\n+                    mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings\r\n+                    frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are\r\n+                    welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them.</p>\r\n+                <p>The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves\r\n+                    who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan identities and affiliations, recognize\r\n+                    related dwarves, and invoke their ancestors’ names in oaths and curses. To be clanless is the worst\r\n+                    fate that can befall a dwarf.</p>\r\n+                <p>Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially weapon smiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some\r\n+                    become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after for their courage and loyalty.</p>\r\n+            </div>\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <div id=\"godsGoldAndClan\">\r\n+                <h5>Gods, Gold, and Clan</h5>\r\n+                <p>Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a desire for treasure—for its own\r\n+                    sake, for a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help others. Other dwarves are\r\n+                    driven by the com m and or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to bring\r\n+                    glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek\r\n+                    to restore a clan’s lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place\r\n+                    within the clan after having been exiled.

An elf typically claim s adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Alignment:</span> Elves love freedom , variety, and sel-fexpression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. The drow are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Size:</span> Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds.

You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Keen Senses:</span> You have proficiency in the Perception skill.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Fey Ancestry:</span> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Trance:</span> Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Languages:</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Subrace:</span> Ancient divides among the elven people resulted in three main subraces: high elves, wood elves, and dark elves, who are commonly called drow.

One type (which includes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk. the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.</p>\r\n+            <p>The sun elves of Faerun (also called gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with gold.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Intelligence score increases by 2.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Elf Weapon Training:</span> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Cantrip:</span> You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list.

This category includes the wild elves (grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of Dragonlance, as well as the races called wood elves in Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms. In Faerun, wood elves (also called wild elves, green elves, or forest elves) are reclusive and distrusting of non-elves.</p>\r\n+            <p>Wood elves’ skin tends to be copperish in hue, sometimes with traces of green. Their hair tends toward browns and blacks, but it is occasionally blond or copper-colored. Their eyes are green, brown, or hazel.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Elf Weapon Training:</span> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Fleet of Foot:</span> Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Mask of the Wild:</span> You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.</p>\r\n+\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <h6>Dark Elf (Drow)</h6>\r\n+            <p></p>\r\n+            <p></p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> </p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Superior Darkvision:</span> </p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Sunlight Sensitivity:</span> </p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Drow Magic:</span> </p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Drow Weapon Training:</span> </p>\r\n+\r\n+            \r\n+        </div>\r\n+        <!-- End collapseStats -->\r\n+        <!-- Start collapseLore -->\r\n+        <div class=\"collapse\" id=\"collapseLore\">\r\n+            <div class=\"dropdown\">\r\n+                <button class=\"btn btn-secondary dropdown-toggle\" type=\"button\" id=\"dropdownMenuButton\"\r\n+                    data-toggle=\"dropdown\" aria-haspopup=\"true\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\r\n+                    Lore\r\n+                </button>\r\n+                <div class=\"dropdown-menu\" aria-labelledby=\"dropdownMenuButton\">\r\n+                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#shortAndStout\">Short and Stout</a>\r\n+                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#longMemoryLongGrudges\">Long Memory, Long Grudges</a>\r\n+                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#clansAndKingdoms\">Clans and Kingdoms</a>\r\n+                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#godsGoldAndClan\">Gods, Gold, and Clan</a>\r\n+                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#dwarfNames\">Dwarf Names</a>\r\n+                </div>\r\n+            </div>\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <div id=\"shortAndStout\">\r\n+                <h5>Short and Stout</h5>\r\n+                <p>Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal.

Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is\r\n+                    usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their\r\n+                    beards highly and groom them carefully.</p>\r\n+            </div>\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <div id=\"longMemoryLongGrudges\">\r\n+                <h5>Long Memory, Long Grudges</h5>\r\n+                <p>Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often rem em ber a very\r\n+                    different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of\r\n+                    the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the\r\n+                    fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a\r\n+                    perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.</p>\r\n+                <p>Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with\r\n+                    stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their\r\n+                    ancestry back to the founding o f their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and\r\n+                    don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the\r\n+                    dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the\r\n+                    forge.</p>\r\n+                <p>Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to\r\n+                    the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense o f justice, and they are slow to forget\r\n+                    wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf’s entire clan, so\r\n+                    what begins as one dwarf’s hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.</p>\r\n+            </div>\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <div id=\"clansAndKingdoms\">\r\n+                <h5>Clans and Kingdoms</h5>\r\n+                <p>Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals\r\n+                    and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry,\r\n+                    and in some dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can’t find in their\r\n+                    mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings\r\n+                    frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are\r\n+                    welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them.</p>\r\n+                <p>The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves\r\n+                    who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan identities and affiliations, recognize\r\n+                    related dwarves, and invoke their ancestors’ names in oaths and curses.

Other dwarves are\r\n+                    driven by the com m and or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to bring\r\n+                    glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek\r\n+                    to restore a clan’s lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place\r\n+                    within the clan after having been exiled.

An elf typically claim s adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Alignment:</span> Elves love freedom , variety, and sel-fexpression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos.

You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Keen Senses:</span> You have proficiency in the Perception skill.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Fey Ancestry:</span> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Trance:</span> Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice.

Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races.

One type (which includes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk. the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.</p>\r\n+            <p>The sun elves of Faerun (also called gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with gold.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Intelligence score increases by 2.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Elf Weapon Training:</span> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Cantrip:</span> You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list.

This category includes the wild elves (grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of Dragonlance, as well as the races called wood elves in Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms. In Faerun, wood elves (also called wild elves, green elves, or forest elves) are reclusive and distrusting of non-elves.</p>\r\n+            <p>Wood elves’ skin tends to be copperish in hue, sometimes with traces of green. Their hair tends toward browns and blacks, but it is occasionally blond or copper-colored. Their eyes are green, brown, or hazel.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Elf Weapon Training:</span> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Fleet of Foot:</span> Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Mask of the Wild:</span> You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.</p>\r\n+\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <h6>Dark Elf (Drow)</h6>\r\n+            <p>Descended from an earlier subrace of dark-skinned elves, the drow were banished from the surface world for following the goddess Lolth down the path to evil and corruption. Now they have built their own civilization in the depths of the Underdark, patterned after the Way of Lolth. Also called dark elves, the drow have black skin that resembles polished obsidian and stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly have very pale eyes (so pale as to be mistaken for white) in shades of lilac, silver, pink, red, and blue. They tend to be smaller and thinner than most elves.</p>\r\n+            <p>Drow adventurers are rare, and the race does not exist in all worlds.

Though\r\n+                    they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a\r\n+                    human standing nearly two feet taller.

Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is\r\n+                    usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their\r\n+                    beards highly and groom them carefully.</p>\r\n+            </div>\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <div id=\"longMemoryLongGrudges\">\r\n+                <h5>Long Memory, Long Grudges</h5>\r\n+                <p>Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often rem em ber a very\r\n+                    different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of\r\n+                    the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the\r\n+                    fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a\r\n+                    perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.</p>\r\n+                <p>Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with\r\n+                    stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their\r\n+                    ancestry back to the founding o f their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and\r\n+                    don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the\r\n+                    dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the\r\n+                    forge.</p>\r\n+                <p>Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to\r\n+                    the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense o f justice, and they are slow to forget\r\n+                    wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf’s entire clan, so\r\n+                    what begins as one dwarf’s hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.</p>\r\n+            </div>\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <div id=\"clansAndKingdoms\">\r\n+                <h5>Clans and Kingdoms</h5>\r\n+                <p>Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals\r\n+                    and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry,\r\n+                    and in some dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can’t find in their\r\n+                    mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings\r\n+                    frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are\r\n+                    welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them.</p>\r\n+                <p>The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves\r\n+                    who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan identities and affiliations, recognize\r\n+                    related dwarves, and invoke their ancestors’ names in oaths and curses.

Other dwarves are\r\n+                    driven by the com m and or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to bring\r\n+                    glory to one of the dwarf gods.

An elf typically claim s adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Alignment:</span> Elves love freedom , variety, and sel-fexpression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. The drow are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Size:</span> Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds.

You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Keen Senses:</span> You have proficiency in the Perception skill.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Fey Ancestry:</span> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Trance:</span> Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Languages:</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Subrace:</span> Ancient divides among the elven people resulted in three main subraces: high elves, wood elves, and dark elves, who are commonly called drow. Choose one of these subraces. In some worlds, these subraces are divided still further (such as the sun elves and moon elves of the Forgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can choose a narrower subrace.</p>\r\n+\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <h6>High Elf</h6>\r\n+            <p>As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds of D&D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type (which includes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk. the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.</p>\r\n+            <p>The sun elves of Faerun (also called gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue.

An elf typically claim s adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Alignment:</span> Elves love freedom , variety, and sel-fexpression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. The drow are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous.

Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Languages:</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races.

The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk. the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.</p>\r\n+            <p>The sun elves of Faerun (also called gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with gold.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Intelligence score increases by 2.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Elf Weapon Training:</span> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Cantrip:</span> You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list.

They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.</p>\r\n+                <p>Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence. They have been known to retreat from intrusions into their woodland homes, confident that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and strategy.</p>\r\n             </div>\r\n             <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n             <div id=\"hiddenWoodlandRealms\">\r\n                 <h5>Hidden Woodland Realms</h5>\r\n-                <p></p>\r\n-                <p></p>\r\n+                <p>Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among the trees. Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow vegetables, and their skill and magic allow them to support themselves without the need for clearing and plowing land. They are talented artisans, crafting finely worked clothes and art objects. Their contact with outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a good living by trading crafted items for metals (which they have no interest in mining).</p>\r\n+                <p>Elves encountered outside their own lands are commonly traveling minstrels, artists, or sages.

Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to day but constantly changing over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and adventuring allows them to do so. Some might join with rebels fighting against oppression, and others might become champions of moral causes.</p>\r\n             </div>\r\n             <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n             <div id=\"elfNames\">\r\n                 <h5>Elf Names</h5>\r\n@@ -187,1820 +187,5 @@\n         crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\r\n     <script src=\"../../scriptMon.js\"></script>\r\n </body>\r\n \r\n-</html>\n-<!doctype html>\r\n-<html lang=\"en\">\r\n-\r\n-<head>\r\n-    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n-    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">\r\n-    <title>Elf</title>\r\n-    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.3.1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\"\r\n-        integrity=\"sha384-ggOyR0iXCbMQv3Xipma34MD+dH/1fQ784/j6cY/iJTQUOhcWr7x9JvoRxT2MZw1T\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\">\r\n-    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"../../style.css\">\r\n-</head>\r\n-\r\n-<body>\r\n-    <header class=\"header-top\">\r\n-        <nav class=\"navbar navbar-expand-lg fixed-top\">\r\n-            <div class=\"container\">\r\n-                <a class=\"navbar-brand\" href=\"../../../index.html\">D&D Resource</a>\r\n-                <button class=\"navbar-toggler navbar-dark\" type=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\"\r\n-                    data-target=\"#navbarNavDropdown\" aria-controls=\"navbarNavDropdown\" aria-expanded=\"false\"\r\n-                    aria-label=\"Toggle navigation\">\r\n-                    <span class=\"navbar-toggler-icon\"></span>\r\n-                </button>\r\n-                <div class=\"collapse navbar-collapse\" id=\"navbarNavDropdown\">\r\n-                    <ul class=\"navbar-nav ml-auto nav justify-content-end\">\r\n-                        <li class=\"nav-item dropdown\">\r\n-                            <a class=\"nav-link dropdown-toggle\" href=\"#\" id=\"navbarResources\" role=\"button\"\r\n-                                data-toggle=\"dropdown\" aria-haspopup=\"true\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\r\n-                                Player Resources\r\n-                            </a>\r\n-                            <div class=\"dropdown-menu\" aria-labelledby=\"navbarResources\">\r\n-                                <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"../../races.html\">Races</a>\r\n-                                <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"../../classes.html\">Classes</a>\r\n-                                <div class=\"dropdown-divider\"></div>\r\n-                                <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"../../bestiary.html\">Bestiary</a>\r\n-                            </div>\r\n-                        </li>\r\n-                        <li class=\"nav-item dropdown\">\r\n-                            <a class=\"nav-link dropdown-toggle\" href=\"#\" id=\"navbarDropdown\" role=\"button\"\r\n-                                data-toggle=\"dropdown\" aria-haspopup=\"true\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\r\n-                                Player Tools\r\n-                            </a>\r\n-                            <div class=\"dropdown-menu\" aria-labelledby=\"navbarDropdown\">\r\n-                                <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"../../../playerTools/charSheet.html\">Character Sheet</a>\r\n-                                <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"../../../playerTools/dice.html\">Dice Roll Generator</a>\r\n-                                <div class=\"dropdown-divider\"></div>\r\n-                                <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#\">More</a>\r\n-                            </div>\r\n-                        </li>\r\n-                    </ul>\r\n-                </div>\r\n-            </div>\r\n-        </nav>\r\n-    </header>\r\n-\r\n-    <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary goBackBtn\" onclick=\"goBack()\">Go Back</button>\r\n-\r\n-    <div class=\"jumbotron\">\r\n-        <h1 class=\"display-4 monsterName\">Elf</h1>\r\n-        <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-        <p>Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it.

An elf typically claim s adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Alignment:</span> Elves love freedom , variety, and sel-fexpression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. The drow are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Size:</span> Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Speed:</span> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Darkvision:</span> Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Keen Senses:</span> You have proficiency in the Perception skill.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Fey Ancestry:</span> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Trance:</span> Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Languages:</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Subrace:</span> Ancient divides among the elven people resulted in three main subraces: high elves, wood elves, and dark elves, who are commonly called drow. Choose one of these subraces. In some worlds, these subraces are divided still further (such as the sun elves and moon elves of the Forgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can choose a narrower subrace.</p>\r\n-\r\n-            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-            <h6>High Elf</h6>\r\n-            <p>As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds of D&D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type (which includes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk. the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.</p>\r\n-            <p>The sun elves of Faerun (also called gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with gold.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Intelligence score increases by 2.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Elf Weapon Training:</span> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Cantrip:</span> You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Extra Language:</span> You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.</p>\r\n-\r\n-            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-            <h6>Wood Elf</h6>\r\n-            <p>As a wood elf, you have keen senses and intuition, and your fleet feet carry you quickly and stealthily through your native forests. This category includes the wild elves (grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of Dragonlance, as well as the races called wood elves in Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms. In Faerun, wood elves (also called wild elves, green elves, or forest elves) are reclusive and distrusting of non-elves.</p>\r\n-            <p>Wood elves’ skin tends to be copperish in hue, sometimes with traces of green. Their hair tends toward browns and blacks, but it is occasionally blond or copper-colored. Their eyes are green, brown, or hazel.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Elf Weapon Training:</span> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Fleet of Foot:</span> Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Mask of the Wild:</span> You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.</p>\r\n-\r\n-            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-            <h6>Dark Elf (Drow)</h6>\r\n-            <p>Descended from an earlier subrace of dark-skinned elves, the drow were banished from the surface world for following the goddess Lolth down the path to evil and corruption. Now they have built their own civilization in the depths of the Underdark, patterned after the Way of Lolth. Also called dark elves, the drow have black skin that resembles polished obsidian and stark white or pale yellow hair.

An elf typically claim s adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Alignment:</span> Elves love freedom , variety, and sel-fexpression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. The drow are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Size:</span> Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Speed:</span> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Darkvision:</span> Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Keen Senses:</span> You have proficiency in the Perception skill.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Fey Ancestry:</span> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Trance:</span> Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Languages:</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Subrace:</span> Ancient divides among the elven people resulted in three main subraces: high elves, wood elves, and dark elves, who are commonly called drow. Choose one of these subraces. In some worlds, these subraces are divided still further (such as the sun elves and moon elves of the Forgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can choose a narrower subrace.</p>\r\n-\r\n-            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-            <h6>High Elf</h6>\r\n-            <p>As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds of D&D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type (which includes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk. the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.</p>\r\n-            <p>The sun elves of Faerun (also called gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with gold.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Intelligence score increases by 2.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Elf Weapon Training:</span> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Cantrip:</span> You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list.

This category includes the wild elves (grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of Dragonlance, as well as the races called wood elves in Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms. In Faerun, wood elves (also called wild elves, green elves, or forest elves) are reclusive and distrusting of non-elves.</p>\r\n-            <p>Wood elves’ skin tends to be copperish in hue, sometimes with traces of green. Their hair tends toward browns and blacks, but it is occasionally blond or copper-colored. Their eyes are green, brown, or hazel.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Elf Weapon Training:</span> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Fleet of Foot:</span> Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Mask of the Wild:</span> You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.</p>\r\n-\r\n-            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-            <h6>Dark Elf (Drow)</h6>\r\n-            <p>Descended from an earlier subrace of dark-skinned elves, the drow were banished from the surface world for following the goddess Lolth down the path to evil and corruption. Now they have built their own civilization in the depths of the Underdark, patterned after the Way of Lolth. Also called dark elves, the drow have black skin that resembles polished obsidian and stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly have very pale eyes (so pale as to be mistaken for white) in shades of lilac, silver, pink, red, and blue. They tend to be smaller and thinner than most elves.</p>\r\n-            <p>Drow adventurers are rare, and the race does not exist in all worlds.

Male dwarves value their\r\n-                    beards highly and groom them carefully.</p>\r\n-            </div>\r\n-            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-            <div id=\"longMemoryLongGrudges\">\r\n-                <h5>Long Memory, Long Grudges</h5>\r\n-                <p>Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often rem em ber a very\r\n-                    different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of\r\n-                    the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the\r\n-                    fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a\r\n-                    perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.</p>\r\n-                <p>Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with\r\n-                    stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their\r\n-                    ancestry back to the founding o f their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and\r\n-                    don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the\r\n-                    dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the\r\n-                    forge.</p>\r\n-                <p>Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to\r\n-                    the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense o f justice, and they are slow to forget\r\n-                    wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf’s entire clan, so\r\n-                    what begins as one dwarf’s hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.</p>\r\n-            </div>\r\n-            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-            <div id=\"clansAndKingdoms\">\r\n-                <h5>Clans and Kingdoms</h5>\r\n-                <p>Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals\r\n-                    and forge items of wonder.

Whatever wealth they can’t find in their\r\n-                    mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings\r\n-                    frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes.

An elf typically claim s adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Alignment:</span> Elves love freedom , variety, and sel-fexpression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. The drow are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Size:</span> Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds.

You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Keen Senses:</span> You have proficiency in the Perception skill.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Fey Ancestry:</span> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Trance:</span> Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Languages:</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races.

One type (which includes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk. the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.</p>\r\n-            <p>The sun elves of Faerun (also called gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with gold.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Intelligence score increases by 2.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Elf Weapon Training:</span> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Cantrip:</span> You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list.

This category includes the wild elves (grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of Dragonlance, as well as the races called wood elves in Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms.

For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of\r\n-                    the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the\r\n-                    fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a\r\n-                    perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.</p>\r\n-                <p>Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with\r\n-                    stoic endurance and little change.

An elf typically claim s adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Alignment:</span> Elves love freedom , variety, and sel-fexpression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. The drow are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous.

Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Subrace:</span> Ancient divides among the elven people resulted in three main subraces: high elves, wood elves, and dark elves, who are commonly called drow. Choose one of these subraces. In some worlds, these subraces are divided still further (such as the sun elves and moon elves of the Forgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can choose a narrower subrace.</p>\r\n-\r\n-            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-            <h6>High Elf</h6>\r\n-            <p>As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds of D&D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type (which includes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk. the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.</p>\r\n-            <p>The sun elves of Faerun (also called gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with gold.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Intelligence score increases by 2.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Elf Weapon Training:</span> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Cantrip:</span> You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list.

For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of\r\n-                    the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the\r\n-                    fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a\r\n-                    perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.</p>\r\n-                <p>Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with\r\n-                    stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their\r\n-                    ancestry back to the founding o f their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and\r\n-                    don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the\r\n-                    dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the\r\n-                    forge.</p>\r\n-                <p>Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to\r\n-                    the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense o f justice, and they are slow to forget\r\n-                    wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf’s entire clan, so\r\n-                    what begins as one dwarf’s hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.</p>\r\n-            </div>\r\n-            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-            <div id=\"clansAndKingdoms\">\r\n-                <h5>Clans and Kingdoms</h5>\r\n-                <p>Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals\r\n-                    and forge items of wonder.

They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings\r\n-                    frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes.

Though\r\n-                    they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a\r\n-                    human standing nearly two feet taller.

For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of\r\n-                    the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the\r\n-                    fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a\r\n-                    perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.</p>\r\n-                <p>Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with\r\n-                    stoic endurance and little change.

Many dwarves have a strong sense o f justice, and they are slow to forget\r\n-                    wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf’s entire clan, so\r\n-                    what begins as one dwarf’s hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.</p>\r\n-            </div>\r\n-            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-            <div id=\"clansAndKingdoms\">\r\n-                <h5>Clans and Kingdoms</h5>\r\n-                <p>Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals\r\n-                    and forge items of wonder.

Though\r\n-                    they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a\r\n-                    human standing nearly two feet taller.

For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of\r\n-                    the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the\r\n-                    fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a\r\n-                    perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.</p>\r\n-                <p>Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with\r\n-                    stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their\r\n-                    ancestry back to the founding o f their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and\r\n-                    don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the\r\n-                    dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the\r\n-                    forge.</p>\r\n-                <p>Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to\r\n-                    the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense o f justice, and they are slow to forget\r\n-                    wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf’s entire clan, so\r\n-                    what begins as one dwarf’s hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.</p>\r\n-            </div>\r\n-            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-            <div id=\"clansAndKingdoms\">\r\n-                <h5>Clans and Kingdoms</h5>\r\n-                <p>Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals\r\n-                    and forge items of wonder.

They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings\r\n-                    frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes.

For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of\r\n-                    the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the\r\n-                    fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years.

Many dwarves have a strong sense o f justice, and they are slow to forget\r\n-                    wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf’s entire clan, so\r\n-                    what begins as one dwarf’s hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.</p>\r\n-            </div>\r\n-            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-            <div id=\"clansAndKingdoms\">\r\n-                <h5>Clans and Kingdoms</h5>\r\n-                <p>Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals\r\n-                    and forge items of wonder.

Your size is Medium.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Speed:</span> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Darkvision:</span> Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Keen Senses:</span> You have proficiency in the Perception skill.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Fey Ancestry:</span> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Trance:</span> Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Languages:</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Subrace:</span> Ancient divides among the elven people resulted in three main subraces: high elves, wood elves, and dark elves, who are commonly called drow. Choose one of these subraces. In some worlds, these subraces are divided still further (such as the sun elves and moon elves of the Forgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can choose a narrower subrace.</p>\r\n+\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <h6>High Elf</h6>\r\n+            <p>As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds of D&D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type (which includes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk. the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.</p>\r\n+            <p>The sun elves of Faerun (also called gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with gold.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Intelligence score increases by 2.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Elf Weapon Training:</span> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Cantrip:</span> You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Extra Language:</span> You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.</p>\r\n+\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <h6>Wood Elf</h6>\r\n+            <p>As a wood elf, you have keen senses and intuition, and your fleet feet carry you quickly and stealthily through your native forests. This category includes the wild elves (grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of Dragonlance, as well as the races called wood elves in Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms. In Faerun, wood elves (also called wild elves, green elves, or forest elves) are reclusive and distrusting of non-elves.</p>\r\n+            <p>Wood elves’ skin tends to be copperish in hue, sometimes with traces of green. Their hair tends toward browns and blacks, but it is occasionally blond or copper-colored. Their eyes are green, brown, or hazel.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Elf Weapon Training:</span> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Fleet of Foot:</span> Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Mask of the Wild:</span> You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.</p>\r\n+\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <h6>Dark Elf (Drow)</h6>\r\n+            <p>Descended from an earlier subrace of dark-skinned elves, the drow were banished from the surface world for following the goddess Lolth down the path to evil and corruption. Now they have built their own civilization in the depths of the Underdark, patterned after the Way of Lolth. Also called dark elves, the drow have black skin that resembles polished obsidian and stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly have very pale eyes (so pale as to be mistaken for white) in shades of lilac, silver, pink, red, and blue. They tend to be smaller and thinner than most elves.</p>\r\n+            <p>Drow adventurers are rare, and the race does not exist in all worlds. Check with your Dungeon Master to see if you can play a drow character.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Charisma score increases by 1.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Superior Darkvision:</span> Your darkvision has a radius of 120 feet.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Sunlight Sensitivity:</span> You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Drow Magic:</span>  You know the dancing lights cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the faerie fire spell once per day. When you reach 5th level, you can also cast the darkness spell once per day. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Drow Weapon Training:</span> You have proficiency with rapiers, shortswords, and hand crossbows.</p>\r\n+\r\n+            \r\n+        </div>\r\n+        <!-- End collapseStats -->\r\n+        <!-- Start collapseLore -->\r\n+        <div class=\"collapse\" id=\"collapseLore\">\r\n+            <div class=\"dropdown\">\r\n+                <button class=\"btn btn-secondary dropdown-toggle\" type=\"button\" id=\"dropdownMenuButton\"\r\n+                    data-toggle=\"dropdown\" aria-haspopup=\"true\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\r\n+                    Lore\r\n+                </button>\r\n+                <div class=\"dropdown-menu\" aria-labelledby=\"dropdownMenuButton\">\r\n+                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#SlenderAndGraceful\">Slender and Graceful</a>\r\n+                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#aTimelessPerspective\">A Timeless Perspective</a>\r\n+                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#hiddenWoodlandRealms\">Hidden Woodland Realms</a>\r\n+                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#explorationAndAdventure\">Exploration and Adventure</a>\r\n+                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#elfNames\">Elf Names</a>\r\n+                </div>\r\n+            </div>\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <div id=\"SlenderAndGraceful\">\r\n+                <h5>Slender and Graceful</h5>\r\n+                <p>With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and members of many other races. They are slightly shorter than humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet tall to just over 6 feet. They are more slender than humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and females are about the same height, and males are only marginally heavier than females.</p>\r\n+                <p>Elves’ coloration encompasses the normal human range and also includes skin in shades of copper, bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have no facial and little body hair. They favor elegant clothing in bright colors, and they enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry.</p>\r\n+            </div>\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <div id=\"aTimelessPerspective\">\r\n+                <h5>A Timeless Perspective</h5>\r\n+                <p>Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorterlived races more deeply. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.</p>\r\n+                <p>Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence. They have been known to retreat from intrusions into their woodland homes, confident that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and strategy.</p>\r\n+            </div>\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <div id=\"hiddenWoodlandRealms\">\r\n+                <h5>Hidden Woodland Realms</h5>\r\n+                <p>Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among the trees. Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow vegetables, and their skill and magic allow them to support themselves without the need for clearing and plowing land. They are talented artisans, crafting finely worked clothes and art objects. Their contact with outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a good living by trading crafted items for metals (which they have no interest in mining).</p>\r\n+                <p>Elves encountered outside their own lands are commonly traveling minstrels, artists, or sages.

Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to day but constantly changing over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and adventuring allows them to do so. Some might join with rebels fighting against oppression, and others might become champions of moral causes.</p>\r\n+            </div>\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <div id=\"elfNames\">\r\n+                <h5>Elf Names</h5>\r\n+                <p>Elves are considered children until they declare themselves adults, some time after the hundredth birthday, and before this period they are called by child names.</p>\r\n+                <p>On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name, although those who knew him or her as a youngster might continue to use the child name. Each elf’s adult name is a unique creation, though it might reflect the names of respected individuals or other family members. Little distinction exists between male names and female names; the groupings here reflect only general tendencies. In addition, every elf bears a family name, typically a combination of other Elvish words.

You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Keen Senses:</span> You have proficiency in the Perception skill.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Fey Ancestry:</span> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Trance:</span> Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Languages:</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Subrace:</span> Ancient divides among the elven people resulted in three main subraces: high elves, wood elves, and dark elves, who are commonly called drow. Choose one of these subraces. In some worlds, these subraces are divided still further (such as the sun elves and moon elves of the Forgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can choose a narrower subrace.</p>\r\n+\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <h6>High Elf</h6>\r\n+            <p>As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds of D&D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type (which includes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk. the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.</p>\r\n+            <p>The sun elves of Faerun (also called gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with gold.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Intelligence score increases by 2.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Elf Weapon Training:</span> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Cantrip:</span> You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Extra Language:</span> You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.</p>\r\n+\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <h6>Wood Elf</h6>\r\n+            <p>As a wood elf, you have keen senses and intuition, and your fleet feet carry you quickly and stealthily through your native forests. This category includes the wild elves (grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of Dragonlance, as well as the races called wood elves in Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms. In Faerun, wood elves (also called wild elves, green elves, or forest elves) are reclusive and distrusting of non-elves.</p>\r\n+            <p>Wood elves’ skin tends to be copperish in hue, sometimes with traces of green. Their hair tends toward browns and blacks, but it is occasionally blond or copper-colored. Their eyes are green, brown, or hazel.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Elf Weapon Training:</span> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Fleet of Foot:</span> Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Mask of the Wild:</span> You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.</p>\r\n+\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <h6>Dark Elf (Drow)</h6>\r\n+            <p>Descended from an earlier subrace of dark-skinned elves, the drow were banished from the surface world for following the goddess Lolth down the path to evil and corruption. Now they have built their own civilization in the depths of the Underdark, patterned after the Way of Lolth. Also called dark elves, the drow have black skin that resembles polished obsidian and stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly have very pale eyes (so pale as to be mistaken for white) in shades of lilac, silver, pink, red, and blue. They tend to be smaller and thinner than most elves.</p>\r\n+            <p>Drow adventurers are rare, and the race does not exist in all worlds. Check with your Dungeon Master to see if you can play a drow character.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Charisma score increases by 1.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Superior Darkvision:</span> Your darkvision has a radius of 120 feet.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Sunlight Sensitivity:</span> You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Drow Magic:</span>  You know the dancing lights cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the faerie fire spell once per day. When you reach 5th level, you can also cast the darkness spell once per day. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>\r\n+            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Drow Weapon Training:</span> You have proficiency with rapiers, shortswords, and hand crossbows.</p>\r\n+\r\n+            \r\n+        </div>\r\n+        <!-- End collapseStats -->\r\n+        <!-- Start collapseLore -->\r\n+        <div class=\"collapse\" id=\"collapseLore\">\r\n+            <div class=\"dropdown\">\r\n+                <button class=\"btn btn-secondary dropdown-toggle\" type=\"button\" id=\"dropdownMenuButton\"\r\n+                    data-toggle=\"dropdown\" aria-haspopup=\"true\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\r\n+                    Lore\r\n+                </button>\r\n+                <div class=\"dropdown-menu\" aria-labelledby=\"dropdownMenuButton\">\r\n+                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#SlenderAndGraceful\">Slender and Graceful</a>\r\n+                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#aTimelessPerspective\">A Timeless Perspective</a>\r\n+                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#hiddenWoodlandRealms\">Hidden Woodland Realms</a>\r\n+                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#explorationAndAdventure\">Exploration and Adventure</a>\r\n+                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#elfNames\">Elf Names</a>\r\n+                </div>\r\n+            </div>\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <div id=\"SlenderAndGraceful\">\r\n+                <h5>Slender and Graceful</h5>\r\n+                <p>With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and members of many other races. They are slightly shorter than humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet tall to just over 6 feet. They are more slender than humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and females are about the same height, and males are only marginally heavier than females.</p>\r\n+                <p>Elves’ coloration encompasses the normal human range and also includes skin in shades of copper, bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have no facial and little body hair. They favor elegant clothing in bright colors, and they enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry.</p>\r\n+            </div>\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <div id=\"aTimelessPerspective\">\r\n+                <h5>A Timeless Perspective</h5>\r\n+                <p>Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorterlived races more deeply. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.</p>\r\n+                <p>Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence. They have been known to retreat from intrusions into their woodland homes, confident that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and strategy.</p>\r\n+            </div>\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <div id=\"hiddenWoodlandRealms\">\r\n+                <h5>Hidden Woodland Realms</h5>\r\n+                <p>Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among the trees. Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow vegetables, and their skill and magic allow them to support themselves without the need for clearing and plowing land. They are talented artisans, crafting finely worked clothes and art objects. Their contact with outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a good living by trading crafted items for metals (which they have no interest in mining).</p>\r\n+                <p>Elves encountered outside their own lands are commonly traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human nobles compete for the services of elf instructors to teach swordplay or magic to their children.</p>\r\n+            </div>\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <div id=\"explorationAndAdventure\">\r\n+                <h5>Exploration and Adventure</h5>\r\n+                <p>Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to day but constantly changing over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and adventuring allows them to do so. Some might join with rebels fighting against oppression, and others might become champions of moral causes.</p>\r\n+            </div>\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <div id=\"elfNames\">\r\n+                <h5>Elf Names</h5>\r\n+                <p>Elves are considered children until they declare themselves adults, some time after the hundredth birthday, and before this period they are called by child names.</p>\r\n+                <p>On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name, although those who knew him or her as a youngster might continue to use the child name. Each elf’s adult name is a unique creation, though it might reflect the names of respected individuals or other family members. Little distinction exists between male names and female names; the groupings here reflect only general tendencies. In addition, every elf bears a family name, typically a combination of other Elvish words. Some elves traveling among humans translate their family names into Common, but others retain the Elvish version.</p>\r\n+                <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Child Names:</span> Ara, Bryn, Del, Eryn, Faen, Innil, Lael, Mella, Naill, Naeris, Phann, Rael, Rinn, Sai, Syllin, Thia, Vall</p>\r\n+                <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Male Adult Names:</span> Adran, Aelar, Aramil, Arannis,Aust, Beiro, Berrian, Carric , Enialis, Erdan, Erevan, Galinndan, Hadarai, Heian, Himo, Immeral, Ivellios, Laucian, Mindartis, Paelias, Peren, Quarion, Riardon, Rolen, Soveliss, Thamior, Tharivol, Theren, Varis</p>\r\n+                <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Female Adult Names:</span> Adrie, Althaea, Anastrianna, Andraste, Antinua, Bethrynna, Birel, Caelynn, Drusilia, Enna, Felosial, Ielenia, Jelenneth, Keyleth, Leshanna, Lia, Meriele, M ialee, Naivara, Quelenna, Quillathe, Sariel, Shanairra, Shava, Silaqui, Theirastra, Thia, Vadania, Valanthe, Xanaphia</p>\r\n+                <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Family Names (Common Translations):</span>  Amakiir (Gemflower), Amastacia (Starflower), Galanodel (Moonwhisper), Holimion (Diam onddew), Ilphelkiir (Gem blossom), Liadon (Silverfrond), Meliamne (Oakenheel), Nai'lo (Nightbreeze), Siannodel (Moonbrook), Xiloscient (Goldpetal)</p>\r\n+            </div>\r\n+            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+            <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary\" onclick=\"goToTop()\">Back to Top</button>\r\n+        </div>\r\n+    </div>\r\n+\r\n+    <!-- End collapseLore -->\r\n+\r\n+    <footer class=\"page-footer font-small blue fixed-bottom\">\r\n+        <p>&copy; Chad Oswald | <a href=\"mailto:chadloswald@gmail.com\">chadloswald@gmail.com</a></p>\r\n+    </footer>\r\n+\r\n+    <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js\"\r\n+        integrity=\"sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo\"\r\n+        crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\r\n+    <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/popper.js@1.14.7/dist/umd/popper.min.js\"\r\n+        integrity=\"sha384-UO2eT0CpHqdSJQ6hJty5KVphtPhzWj9WO1clHTMGa3JDZwrnQq4sF86dIHNDz0W1\"\r\n+        crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\r\n+    <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.3.1/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js\"\r\n+        integrity=\"sha384-JjSmVgyd0p3pXB1rRibZUAYoIIy6OrQ6VrjIEaFf/nJGzIxFDsf4x0xIM+B07jRM\"\r\n+        crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\r\n+    <script src=\"../../scriptMon.js\"></script>\r\n+</body>\r\n+\r\n+</html>\n\\ No newline at end of file\n"

Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.</p>\r\n-        <hr class=\"my-4\">\r\n-        <div class=\"monsterImageContainer\">\r\n-            <img class=\"monsterPortrait\" src=\"../../images/elf.png\" alt=\"Elf image\">\r\n-        </div>\r\n-        <div class=\"btn-group\" role=\"group\" aria-label=\"Basic example\">\r\n-            <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" href=\"#collapseStats\" role=\"button\"\r\n-                aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapseBasic\" onclick=\"scrollToStats()\">Traits</button>\r\n-            <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" href=\"#collapseLore\" role=\"button\"\r\n-                aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapseBasic\" onclick=\"scrollToLore()\">Lore</button>\r\n-        </div>\r\n-\r\n-        <!-- Start collapseStats -->\r\n-        <div class=\"collapse\" id=\"collapseStats\">\r\n-            <h4>Traits</h4>\r\n-            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-            <p>Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of elven refinement.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Dexterity score increases by 2.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Age:</span> Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claim s adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Alignment:</span> Elves love freedom , variety, and sel-fexpression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. The drow are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Size:</span> Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Speed:</span> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Darkvision:</span> Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Keen Senses:</span> You have proficiency in the Perception skill.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Fey Ancestry:</span> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Trance:</span> Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Languages:</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Subrace:</span> Ancient divides among the elven people resulted in three main subraces: high elves, wood elves, and dark elves, who are commonly called drow. Choose one of these subraces. In some worlds, these subraces are divided still further (such as the sun elves and moon elves of the Forgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can choose a narrower subrace.</p>\r\n-\r\n-            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-            <h6>High Elf</h6>\r\n-            <p>As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds of D&D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type (which includes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk. the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.</p>\r\n-            <p>The sun elves of Faerun (also called gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with gold.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Intelligence score increases by 2.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Elf Weapon Training:</span> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Cantrip:</span> You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Extra Language:</span> You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.</p>\r\n-\r\n-            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-            <h6>Wood Elf</h6>\r\n-            <p>As a wood elf, you have keen senses and intuition, and your fleet feet carry you quickly and stealthily through your native forests. This category includes the wild elves (grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of Dragonlance, as well as the races called wood elves in Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms. In Faerun, wood elves (also called wild elves, green elves, or forest elves) are reclusive and distrusting of non-elves.</p>\r\n-            <p>Wood elves’ skin tends to be copperish in hue, sometimes with traces of green. Their hair tends toward browns and blacks, but it is occasionally blond or copper-colored. Their eyes are green, brown, or hazel.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Elf Weapon Training:</span> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Fleet of Foot:</span> Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Mask of the Wild:</span> You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.</p>\r\n-\r\n-            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-            <h6>Dark Elf (Drow)</h6>\r\n-            <p>Descended from an earlier subrace of dark-skinned elves, the drow were banished from the surface world for following the goddess Lolth down the path to evil and corruption. Now they have built their own civilization in the depths of the Underdark, patterned after the Way of Lolth. Also called dark elves, the drow have black skin that resembles polished obsidian and stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly have very pale eyes (so pale as to be mistaken for white) in shades of lilac, silver, pink, red, and blue. They tend to be smaller and thinner than most elves.</p>\r\n-            <p>Drow adventurers are rare, and the race does not exist in all worlds. Check with your Dungeon Master to see if you can play a drow character.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Charisma score increases by 1.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Superior Darkvision:</span> Your darkvision has a radius of 120 feet.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Sunlight Sensitivity:</span> You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Drow Magic:</span>  You know the dancing lights cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the faerie fire spell once per day. When you reach 5th level, you can also cast the darkness spell once per day. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Drow Weapon Training:</span> You have proficiency with rapiers, shortswords, and hand crossbows.</p>\r\n-\r\n-            \r\n-        </div>\r\n-        <!-- End collapseStats -->\r\n-        <!-- Start collapseLore -->\r\n-        <div class=\"collapse\" id=\"collapseLore\">\r\n-            <div class=\"dropdown\">\r\n-                <button class=\"btn btn-secondary dropdown-toggle\" type=\"button\" id=\"dropdownMenuButton\"\r\n-                    data-toggle=\"dropdown\" aria-haspopup=\"true\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\r\n-                    Lore\r\n-                </button>\r\n-                <div class=\"dropdown-menu\" aria-labelledby=\"dropdownMenuButton\">\r\n-                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#SlenderAndGraceful\">Slender and Graceful</a>\r\n-                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#aTimelessPerspective\">A Timeless Perspective</a>\r\n-                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#hiddenWoodlandRealms\">Hidden Woodland Realms</a>\r\n-                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#explorationAndAdventure\">Exploration and Adventure</a>\r\n-                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#elfNames\">Elf Names</a>\r\n-                </div>\r\n-            </div>\r\n-            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-            <div id=\"SlenderAndGraceful\">\r\n-                <h5>Slender and Graceful</h5>\r\n-                <p>With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and members of many other races. They are slightly shorter than humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet tall to just over 6 feet. They are more slender than humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and females are about the same height, and males are only marginally heavier than females.</p>\r\n-                <p>Elves’ coloration encompasses the normal human range and also includes skin in shades of copper, bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have no facial and little body hair. They favor elegant clothing in bright colors, and they enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry.</p>\r\n-            </div>\r\n-            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-            <div id=\"aTimelessPerspective\">\r\n-                <h5>A Timeless Perspective</h5>\r\n-                <p>Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorterlived races more deeply. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.</p>\r\n-                <p>Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence. They have been known to retreat from intrusions into their woodland homes, confident that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and strategy.</p>\r\n-            </div>\r\n-            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-            <div id=\"hiddenWoodlandRealms\">\r\n-                <h5>Hidden Woodland Realms</h5>\r\n-                <p>Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among the trees. Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow vegetables, and their skill and magic allow them to support themselves without the need for clearing and plowing land. They are talented artisans, crafting finely worked clothes and art objects. Their contact with outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a good living by trading crafted items for metals (which they have no interest in mining).</p>\r\n-                <p>Elves encountered outside their own lands are commonly traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human nobles compete for the services of elf instructors to teach swordplay or magic to their children.</p>\r\n-            </div>\r\n-            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-            <div id=\"explorationAndAdventure\">\r\n-                <h5>Exploration and Adventure</h5>\r\n-                <p>Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to day but constantly changing over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and adventuring allows them to do so. Some might join with rebels fighting against oppression, and others might become champions of moral causes.</p>\r\n-            </div>\r\n-            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-            <div id=\"elfNames\">\r\n-                <h5>Elf Names</h5>\r\n-                <p>Elves are considered children until they declare themselves adults, some time after the hundredth birthday, and before this period they are called by child names.</p>\r\n-                <p>On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name, although those who knew him or her as a youngster might continue to use the child name. Each elf’s adult name is a unique creation, though it might reflect the names of respected individuals or other family members. Little distinction exists between male names and female names; the groupings here reflect only general tendencies. In addition, every elf bears a family name, typically a combination of other Elvish words.

They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.</p>\r\n-        <hr class=\"my-4\">\r\n-        <div class=\"monsterImageContainer\">\r\n-            <img class=\"monsterPortrait\" src=\"../../images/elf.png\" alt=\"Elf image\">\r\n-        </div>\r\n-        <div class=\"btn-group\" role=\"group\" aria-label=\"Basic example\">\r\n-            <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" href=\"#collapseStats\" role=\"button\"\r\n-                aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapseBasic\" onclick=\"scrollToStats()\">Traits</button>\r\n-            <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" href=\"#collapseLore\" role=\"button\"\r\n-                aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapseBasic\" onclick=\"scrollToLore()\">Lore</button>\r\n-        </div>\r\n-\r\n-        <!-- Start collapseStats -->\r\n-        <div class=\"collapse\" id=\"collapseStats\">\r\n-            <h4>Traits</h4>\r\n-            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-            <p>Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of elven refinement.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Dexterity score increases by 2.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Age:</span> Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claim s adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Alignment:</span> Elves love freedom , variety, and sel-fexpression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. The drow are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Size:</span> Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Speed:</span> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Darkvision:</span> Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Keen Senses:</span> You have proficiency in the Perception skill.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Fey Ancestry:</span> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Trance:</span> Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Languages:</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Subrace:</span> Ancient divides among the elven people resulted in three main subraces: high elves, wood elves, and dark elves, who are commonly called drow. Choose one of these subraces. In some worlds, these subraces are divided still further (such as the sun elves and moon elves of the Forgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can choose a narrower subrace.</p>\r\n-\r\n-            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-            <h6>High Elf</h6>\r\n-            <p>As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds of D&D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type (which includes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk. the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.</p>\r\n-            <p>The sun elves of Faerun (also called gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with gold.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Intelligence score increases by 2.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Elf Weapon Training:</span> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Cantrip:</span> You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Extra Language:</span> You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.</p>\r\n-\r\n-            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-            <h6>Wood Elf</h6>\r\n-            <p>As a wood elf, you have keen senses and intuition, and your fleet feet carry you quickly and stealthily through your native forests. This category includes the wild elves (grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of Dragonlance, as well as the races called wood elves in Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms. In Faerun, wood elves (also called wild elves, green elves, or forest elves) are reclusive and distrusting of non-elves.</p>\r\n-            <p>Wood elves’ skin tends to be copperish in hue, sometimes with traces of green. Their hair tends toward browns and blacks, but it is occasionally blond or copper-colored. Their eyes are green, brown, or hazel.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Elf Weapon Training:</span> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Fleet of Foot:</span> Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Mask of the Wild:</span> You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.</p>\r\n-\r\n-            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-            <h6>Dark Elf (Drow)</h6>\r\n-            <p>Descended from an earlier subrace of dark-skinned elves, the drow were banished from the surface world for following the goddess Lolth down the path to evil and corruption. Now they have built their own civilization in the depths of the Underdark, patterned after the Way of Lolth. Also called dark elves, the drow have black skin that resembles polished obsidian and stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly have very pale eyes (so pale as to be mistaken for white) in shades of lilac, silver, pink, red, and blue. They tend to be smaller and thinner than most elves.</p>\r\n-            <p>Drow adventurers are rare, and the race does not exist in all worlds. Check with your Dungeon Master to see if you can play a drow character.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Charisma score increases by 1.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Superior Darkvision:</span> Your darkvision has a radius of 120 feet.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Sunlight Sensitivity:</span> You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Drow Magic:</span>  You know the dancing lights cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the faerie fire spell once per day. When you reach 5th level, you can also cast the darkness spell once per day. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>\r\n-            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Drow Weapon Training:</span> You have proficiency with rapiers, shortswords, and hand crossbows.</p>\r\n-\r\n-            \r\n-        </div>\r\n-        <!-- End collapseStats -->\r\n-        <!-- Start collapseLore -->\r\n-        <div class=\"collapse\" id=\"collapseLore\">\r\n-            <div class=\"dropdown\">\r\n-                <button class=\"btn btn-secondary dropdown-toggle\" type=\"button\" id=\"dropdownMenuButton\"\r\n-                    data-toggle=\"dropdown\" aria-haspopup=\"true\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\r\n-                    Lore\r\n-                </button>\r\n-                <div class=\"dropdown-menu\" aria-labelledby=\"dropdownMenuButton\">\r\n-                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#SlenderAndGraceful\">Slender and Graceful</a>\r\n-                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#aTimelessPerspective\">A Timeless Perspective</a>\r\n-                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#hiddenWoodlandRealms\">Hidden Woodland Realms</a>\r\n-                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#explorationAndAdventure\">Exploration and Adventure</a>\r\n-                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#elfNames\">Elf Names</a>\r\n-                </div>\r\n-            </div>\r\n-            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-            <div id=\"SlenderAndGraceful\">\r\n-                <h5>Slender and Graceful</h5>\r\n-                <p>With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and members of many other races. They are slightly shorter than humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet tall to just over 6 feet. They are more slender than humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and females are about the same height, and males are only marginally heavier than females.</p>\r\n-                <p>Elves’ coloration encompasses the normal human range and also includes skin in shades of copper, bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have no facial and little body hair. They favor elegant clothing in bright colors, and they enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry.</p>\r\n-            </div>\r\n-            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-            <div id=\"aTimelessPerspective\">\r\n-                <h5>A Timeless Perspective</h5>\r\n-                <p>Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorterlived races more deeply. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.</p>\r\n-                <p>Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence. They have been known to retreat from intrusions into their woodland homes, confident that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and strategy.</p>\r\n-            </div>\r\n-            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-            <div id=\"hiddenWoodlandRealms\">\r\n-                <h5>Hidden Woodland Realms</h5>\r\n-                <p>Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among the trees. Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow vegetables, and their skill and magic allow them to support themselves without the need for clearing and plowing land. They are talented artisans, crafting finely worked clothes and art objects. Their contact with outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a good living by trading crafted items for metals (which they have no interest in mining).</p>\r\n-                <p>Elves encountered outside their own lands are commonly traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human nobles compete for the services of elf instructors to teach swordplay or magic to their children.</p>\r\n-            </div>\r\n-            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-            <div id=\"explorationAndAdventure\">\r\n-                <h5>Exploration and Adventure</h5>\r\n-                <p>Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to day but constantly changing over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and adventuring allows them to do so.

Though\r\n                    they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a\r\n                    human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any\r\n                    of the larger folk.</p>\r\n                <p>Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are\r\n                    light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is\r\n                    usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their\r\n                    beards highly and groom them carefully.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n            <div id=\"longMemoryLongGrudges\">\r\n                <h5>Long Memory, Long Grudges</h5>\r\n                <p>Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often rem em ber a very\r\n                    different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of\r\n                    the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the\r\n                    fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a\r\n                    perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.</p>\r\n                <p>Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with\r\n                    stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their\r\n                    ancestry back to the founding o f their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and\r\n                    don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the\r\n                    dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the\r\n                    forge.</p>\r\n                <p>Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to\r\n                    the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense o f justice, and they are slow to forget\r\n                    wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf’s entire clan, so\r\n                    what begins as one dwarf’s hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n            <div id=\"clansAndKingdoms\">\r\n                <h5>Clans and Kingdoms</h5>\r\n                <p>Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals\r\n                    and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry,\r\n                    and in some dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can’t find in their\r\n                    mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings\r\n                    frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are\r\n                    welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them.</p>\r\n                <p>The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves\r\n                    who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan identities and affiliations, recognize\r\n                    related dwarves, and invoke their ancestors’ names in oaths and curses. To be clanless is the worst\r\n                    fate that can befall a dwarf.</p>\r\n                <p>Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially weapon smiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some\r\n                    become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after for their courage and loyalty.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n            <div id=\"godsGoldAndClan\">\r\n                <h5>Gods, Gold, and Clan</h5>\r\n                <p>Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a desire for treasure—for its own\r\n                    sake, for a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help others. Other dwarves are\r\n                    driven by the com m and or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to bring\r\n                    glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek\r\n                    to restore a clan’s lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place\r\n                    within the clan after having been exiled.
