other halflings.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Dexterity score increases by 2.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Age:</span> A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives\r\n                into the middle of his or her second century.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Alignment:</span> Most halflings are lawful good. As a rule, they are\r\n                good-hearted and kind, hate to see others in pain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are also\r\n                very orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on the support of their community and the comfort of their\r\n                old ways.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Size:</span> Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your\r\n                size is Small.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Speed:</span> Your base walking speed is 25 feet.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Lucky:</span> When you roll a 1 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving\r\n                throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Brave:</span> You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Halfling Nimbleness:</span> You can move through the space of any creature that\r\n                is of a size larger than yours.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Languages:</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The\r\n                Halfling language isn’t secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others. They write very little,\r\n                so they don’t have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all\r\n                halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands hey dwell or through which they are\r\n                traveling.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Subrace:</span> The two main kinds of halfling, lightfoot and stout, are more\r\n                like closely related families than true subraces. Choose one of these subraces.</p>\r\n\r\n            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n            <h6>Lightfoot</h6>\r\n            <p>As a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from notice, even using other people as cover. You’re\r\n                inclined to be affable and get along well with others. In the Forgotten Realms, lightfoot halflings have\r\n                spread the farthest and thus are the most com m on variety.</p>\r\n            <p>Lightfoots are m ore prone to wanderlust than other halflings, and often dwell alongside other races or\r\n                take up a nomadic life. In the world of Greyhawk, these halflings are called hairfeet or tallfellows.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Charisma score increases by 1.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Naturally Stealthy:</span> You can attempt to hide even when you are obscured\r\n                only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.</p>\r\n\r\n            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n            <h6>Stout</h6>\r\n            <p>As a stout halfling, you’re hardier than average and have some resistance to poison. Some say that stouts\r\n                have dwarven blood. In the Forgotten Realms, these halflings are called stronghearts, and they’re most\r\n                common in the south.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Constitution score increases by 1.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Stout Resilience:</span> You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and\r\n                you have resistance against poison damage.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <!-- End collapseStats -->\r\n        <!-- Start collapseLore -->\r\n        <div class=\"collapse rounded\" id=\"collapseLore\">\r\n            <div class=\"dropdown\">\r\n                <button class=\"btn btn-secondary dropdown-toggle\" type=\"button\" id=\"dropdownMenuButton\"\r\n                    data-toggle=\"dropdown\" aria-haspopup=\"true\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\r\n                    Lore\r\n                </button>\r\n                <div class=\"dropdown-menu\" aria-labelledby=\"dropdownMenuButton\">\r\n                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#smallAndPractical\">Small and Practical</a>\r\n                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#kindAndCurious\">Kind and Curious</a>\r\n                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#blendIntoTheCrowd\">Blend into the Crowd</a>\r\n                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#pastoralPleasantries\">Pastoral Pleasantries</a>\r\n                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#exploringOpportunities\">Exploring Opportunities</a>\r\n                    <a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#halflingNames\">Halfling Names</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n            <div id=\"smallAndPractical\">\r\n                <h5>Small and Practical</h5>\r\n                <p>The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger creatures by avoiding notice or, barring\r\n                    that, avoiding offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively harmless and so have\r\n                    managed to survive for centuries in the shadow of empires and on the edges of wars and political\r\n                    strife. They are inclined to be stout, weighing between 40 and 45 pounds.</p>\r\n                <p>Halflings’ skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy cast, and their hair is usually brown or sandy\r\n                    brown and wavy. They have brown or hazel eyes. Halfling men often sport long sideburns, but beards\r\n                    are rare among them and mustaches even more so. They like to wear simple, comfortable, and practical\r\n                    clothes, favoring bright colors.</p>\r\n                <p>Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing. They’re concerned with basic needs and simple\r\n                    pleasures and have little use for ostentation. Even the wealthiest of halflings keep their treasures\r\n                    locked in a cellar rather than on display for all to see. They have a knack for finding the most\r\n                    straightforward solution to a problem, and have little patience for dithering.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n            <div id=\"kindAndCurious\">\r\n                <h5>Kind and Curious</h5>\r\n                <p>Halflings are an affable and cheerful people.

Even adventurers among\r\n                    them usually venture into the world for reasons of community, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity.\r\n                    They love discovering new things, even simple things, such as an exotic food or an unfamiliar style\r\n                    of clothing.</p>\r\n                <p>Halflings are easily moved to pity and hate to see any living thing suffer.
