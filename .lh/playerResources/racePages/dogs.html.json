Their main preoccupation is themselves and the small circle of loved ones they seek to protect.\r\n-        This can occasionally seem like callousness or disinterest in the larger world. This is often misleading,\r\n-        however.</p>\r\n-      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Size:</span> While there are larger and smaller cats, this variation in size and length\r\n-        is much more limited than it is in dogs.

Cats are proficient with this attack, which\r\n-        counts as both a weapon attack and an unarmed attack. The attack does 1d6 damage plus the attacker's STR\r\n-        modifier bonus.</p>\r\n-      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Languages:</span> A cat can speak and read Common, Feline, and one other language. Cats\r\n-        only use language with humans and other races; when with each other, they communicate entirely through gesture,\r\n-        small inflections of the face and eyes, and carefully modulated thrusts of the paw or flank.

Neither too large, nor too small. Purrfect, you might say. Play a medium cat if you want to be\r\n+        a tabby, a bengal or an American bobtail; you're the kind of cat who knows how the world works.

Reduce the difficulty of all climb tests by 2.</p>\r\n+      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Feline Intuition:</span> You know things. Even if you're not entirely sure how\r\n+        sometimes, you just do... Gain +1 to INT score permanently.</p>\r\n+      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Gone!:</span> No thanks, you're not sticking around to be smashed with a mace. You know\r\n+        how to stay safe and stay alive. When fleeing or escaping from combat, double your Base Speed.</p>\r\n+      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Attention must be Paid!:</span> Are they...ignoring you? Have they seen what you look\r\n+        like? Well, you'll soon put a stop to that. Add Proficiency bonus to all Charisma checks.</p>\r\n+      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Skilled Hunter:</span> You can follow your prey through any terrain, no one is getting\r\n+        away from you! Add +2 to all Tracking rolls.</p>\r\n+      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Action Cat:</span> You're always ready for what comes next; you're poised, cunning and\r\n+        able to anticipate. Add +1 to your Initiative Modifier.</p>\r\n+      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Like Smoke:</span> The enemy flails about them, trying to hit you. But you've already\r\n+        gone, like mist in a strong breeze. Whenever attempting to move past an enemy, or disengage from combat, you may\r\n+        avoid the first Attack of Opportunity made by an enemy.</p>\r\n+      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Flower Marked:</span> Your distinctive patterned fur is actually highly effective\r\n+        camouflage, making you difficult to spot in the wilderness. You have advantage on all stealth rolls made in\r\n+        natural terrain, like forest or jungle.</p>\r\n+      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Lands on Feet:</span> You are incredibly agile, so much so that even falling from a\r\n+        great height seems to scarcely affect you. Whenever you take fall damage, it is halved.</p>\r\n+      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Good Luck Cat:</span> You're just...lucky! You don't know why, but you are. Once per\r\n+        session, you may reroll one failed test.</p>\r\n+      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Life in the Shadows:</span> Twilight is your element, your coloring and lithe form\r\n+        making you almost impossible to track as the light dims. Whenever you are in partial or reduced light, you gain\r\n+        a +2 to all stealth roles.</p>\r\n+      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Like a Wolf:</span> As you shed your fur, you begin to resemble a vicious wolf, teeth\r\n+        bared and hungry for blood. You know how to use this appearance to your own ends! Whenever making an Intimidate\r\n+        check, you may use your proficiency bonus on top of any other modifiers.</p>\r\n+      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Big Unit:</span> Hulking and mighty, it doesn't matter that you aren't as big as a\r\n+        Dragon...you pack just as much into a smaller package! Add +1 to your strength attribute.</p>\r\n+      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Defensive Fluff:</span> Your fun is spectacularly fluffy, softening the blows of your\r\n+        enemies and protecting you against whatever forces you must confront. Add +1 to your Armor Class.</p>\r\n+      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Adaptation:</span> You were born in freezing cold conditions, you're used to them,\r\n+        capable of putting up with anything. You are Resistant to Cold Damage.</p>\r\n+      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Go Limp:</span> You're spent a lot of time going limp and playing dead. You're eerily\r\n+        good at it, in fact, but you're learned something more while lying there, unmoving. When knocked Prone, you\r\n+        suffer no disadvantages to avoiding or evading attacks.</p>\r\n+      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Everybody Wants to be a Cat:</span> You know it's natural to envy your grace, your fur,\r\n+        your beauty. How could they not? They won't get close , of course, but they can always watch you. Add +1 to your\r\n+        Charisma Attribute.</p>\r\n+      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">And... Push: Things need pushing!:</span> That's what they're there for! Just give them\r\n+        a little nudge and see what happens! Whenever attempting to move a stationary object, you may add your\r\n+        Proficiency bonus to the roll.</p>\r\n+      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Stubborn:</span> You don't go down. You've been in a lot of fights and you don't like\r\n+        losing. You don't lime doing anything unless you want to do it. When you're reduced to 0 hit points in combat,\r\n+        make a DC 14 Constitution save. If you succeed, you are not knocked unconscious but remain standing, on 1 hit\r\n+        point. This ability can be used once per combat.</p>\r\n+      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Light Sleeper:</span> You don't need much in the way of recovery time. You can get by\r\n+        in a way others can't. When Short Resting, determine the number of hit points regained in the normal fashion\r\n+        (roll a Hit Dice and add the COnstitution modifier), then add an additional 1d4+2 hit points to the total.</p>\r\n+      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Slippery Customer:</span> Someone with your dignity is, most assuredly, not going to be\r\n+        manhandled! Whenever an enemy attempts to grapple you, you make your opposing Dexterity roll at Advantage.</p>\r\n+      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n+      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Nine Lives:</span> Everyone knows that cats are too fast for death to catch.

Dogs tend towards good alignments due to their natural urge to be helpful, but there are exceptions.</p>\r\n-      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Size:</span> Dogs vary in height and length enormously. Your size is dependent on your subrace.</p>\r\n-      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Speed:</span> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\r\n-      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Languages:</span> You ca 'speak' and read Common and two extra languages of your choice. Note </p>\r\n-      \r\n-      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">All so Different:</span> There are many different varieties of cat breed, each with\r\n-        their own idiosyncrasies, preferences, and behaviors - remember that any breed can belong to any of the three\r\n-        subraces; cats are born at all sizes. Choose a feline subrace from the list below and then choose one ability\r\n-        from the Cat Abilities list. You may only choose one such ability.</p>\r\n-\r\n-      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-      <h6>Hefty Cat</h6>\r\n-      <p>These big, substantial cats are the biggest of their kind and are tougher and more durable than their feline\r\n-        kin. If you want to play a Maine Coon, a Norwegian Forest Cat or just an unusually chunky version of your\r\n-        favorite breed, choose a Large Cat!</p>\r\n-      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Gain +1 to your Strength attribute</p>\r\n-\r\n-      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-      <h6>Regular Cat</h6>\r\n-      <p>The typical cat. Neither too large, nor too small. Purrfect, you might say. Play a medium cat if you want to be\r\n-        a tabby, a bengal or an American bobtail; you're the kind of cat who knows how the world works. You can live in\r\n-        a home, or in the wild.</p>\r\n-      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Gain +1 to your Wisdom attribute</p>\r\n-\r\n-      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-      <h6>Lap Cat</h6>\r\n-      <p>Smaller, more delicate and all the smarter for it, Lap Cats are experts at getting others to do the work for\r\n-        them. After all, when you're this adorable, why wouldn't you? Play a lap cat if you want to be a Persian, a\r\n-        sphynx or a ragdoll - or if you just want to be small, cute and loveable.</p>\r\n-      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Gain +1 to your Charisma attribute</p>\r\n-    </div>\r\n-    <!-- End collapseStats -->\r\n-    <!-- Start collapseLore -->\r\n-    <div class=\"collapse rounded\" id=\"collapseLore\">\r\n-\r\n-      <h4>Cat Abilities</h4>\r\n-      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">How Did They Get Up There?:</span> Moving with preternatural speed and grace, you\r\n-        scramble up sheer surfaces with ease. Reduce the difficulty of all climb tests by 2.</p>\r\n-      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Feline Intuition:</span> You know things. Even if you're not entirely sure how\r\n-        sometimes, you just do... Gain +1 to INT score permanently.</p>\r\n-      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Gone!:</span> No thanks, you're not sticking around to be smashed with a mace. You know\r\n-        how to stay safe and stay alive. When fleeing or escaping from combat, double your Base Speed.</p>\r\n-      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Attention must be Paid!:</span> Are they...ignoring you? Have they seen what you look\r\n-        like? Well, you'll soon put a stop to that. Add Proficiency bonus to all Charisma checks.</p>\r\n-      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Skilled Hunter:</span> You can follow your prey through any terrain, no one is getting\r\n-        away from you! Add +2 to all Tracking rolls.</p>\r\n-      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Action Cat:</span> You're always ready for what comes next; you're poised, cunning and\r\n-        able to anticipate. Add +1 to your Initiative Modifier.</p>\r\n-      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Like Smoke:</span> The enemy flails about them, trying to hit you. But you've already\r\n-        gone, like mist in a strong breeze. Whenever attempting to move past an enemy, or disengage from combat, you may\r\n-        avoid the first Attack of Opportunity made by an enemy.</p>\r\n-      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Flower Marked:</span> Your distinctive patterned fur is actually highly effective\r\n-        camouflage, making you difficult to spot in the wilderness. You have advantage on all stealth rolls made in\r\n-        natural terrain, like forest or jungle.</p>\r\n-      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Lands on Feet:</span> You are incredibly agile, so much so that even falling from a\r\n-        great height seems to scarcely affect you. Whenever you take fall damage, it is halved.</p>\r\n-      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Good Luck Cat:</span> You're just...lucky! You don't know why, but you are. Once per\r\n-        session, you may reroll one failed test.</p>\r\n-      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Life in the Shadows:</span> Twilight is your element, your coloring and lithe form\r\n-        making you almost impossible to track as the light dims. Whenever you are in partial or reduced light, you gain\r\n-        a +2 to all stealth roles.</p>\r\n-      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Like a Wolf:</span> As you shed your fur, you begin to resemble a vicious wolf, teeth\r\n-        bared and hungry for blood. You know how to use this appearance to your own ends! Whenever making an Intimidate\r\n-        check, you may use your proficiency bonus on top of any other modifiers.</p>\r\n-      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Big Unit:</span> Hulking and mighty, it doesn't matter that you aren't as big as a\r\n-        Dragon...you pack just as much into a smaller package! Add +1 to your strength attribute.</p>\r\n-      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Defensive Fluff:</span> Your fun is spectacularly fluffy, softening the blows of your\r\n-        enemies and protecting you against whatever forces you must confront. Add +1 to your Armor Class.</p>\r\n-      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Adaptation:</span> You were born in freezing cold conditions, you're used to them,\r\n-        capable of putting up with anything. You are Resistant to Cold Damage.</p>\r\n-      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Go Limp:</span> You're spent a lot of time going limp and playing dead. You're eerily\r\n-        good at it, in fact, but you're learned something more while lying there, unmoving. When knocked Prone, you\r\n-        suffer no disadvantages to avoiding or evading attacks.</p>\r\n-      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Everybody Wants to be a Cat:</span> You know it's natural to envy your grace, your fur,\r\n-        your beauty. How could they not? They won't get close , of course, but they can always watch you. Add +1 to your\r\n-        Charisma Attribute.</p>\r\n-      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">And... Push: Things need pushing!:</span> That's what they're there for! Just give them\r\n-        a little nudge and see what happens! Whenever attempting to move a stationary object, you may add your\r\n-        Proficiency bonus to the roll.</p>\r\n-      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Stubborn:</span> You don't go down. You've been in a lot of fights and you don't like\r\n-        losing. You don't lime doing anything unless you want to do it. When you're reduced to 0 hit points in combat,\r\n-        make a DC 14 Constitution save. If you succeed, you are not knocked unconscious but remain standing, on 1 hit\r\n-        point. This ability can be used once per combat.</p>\r\n-      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Light Sleeper:</span> You don't need much in the way of recovery time. You can get by\r\n-        in a way others can't. When Short Resting, determine the number of hit points regained in the normal fashion\r\n-        (roll a Hit Dice and add the COnstitution modifier), then add an additional 1d4+2 hit points to the total.</p>\r\n-      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Slippery Customer:</span> Someone with your dignity is, most assuredly, not going to be\r\n-        manhandled! Whenever an enemy attempts to grapple you, you make your opposing Dexterity roll at Advantage.</p>\r\n-      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n-      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Nine Lives:</span> Everyone knows that cats are too fast for death to catch.

<div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n      <p>While the many different breeds of cat make generalizing difficult, there are a few traits which pertain to all\r\n        felines:</p>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> All cats increase their DEX score by 2.</p>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Age:</span> Cats reach maturity between the age of 1 or 2, and live, on average to the\r\n        age of 15.</p>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Alignment:</span> Cats tend toward neutral alignments; they are very rarely wholly evil\r\n        or wholly good. Their main preoccupation is themselves and the small circle of loved ones they seek to protect.\r\n        This can occasionally seem like callousness or disinterest in the larger world. This is often misleading,\r\n        however.</p>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Size:</span> While there are larger and smaller cats, this variation in size and length\r\n        is much more limited than it is in dogs. As a result, all cats are considered small.</p>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Speed:</span> A cat's base speed is 30 feet.</p>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Darkvision:</span> Cats have darkvision up to 60 ft.</p>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Bite & Scratch:</span> Sharp teeth, and claws which can be quickly unsheathed and used\r\n        to slice through flesh - all cats possess these natural weapons. Cats are proficient with this attack, which\r\n        counts as both a weapon attack and an unarmed attack. The attack does 1d6 damage plus the attacker's STR\r\n        modifier bonus.</p>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Languages:</span> A cat can speak and read Common, Feline, and one other language. Cats\r\n        only use language with humans and other races; when with each other, they communicate entirely through gesture,\r\n        small inflections of the face and eyes, and carefully modulated thrusts of the paw or flank. This language is\r\n        called Feline and can only be spoken fluently by other cats.</p>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">All so Different:</span> There are many different varieties of cat breed, each with\r\n        their own idiosyncrasies, preferences, and behaviors - remember that any breed can belong to any of the three\r\n        subraces; cats are born at all sizes. Choose a feline subrace from the list below and then choose one ability\r\n        from the Cat Abilities list. You may only choose one such ability.</p>\r\n\r\n      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n      <h6>Hefty Cat</h6>\r\n      <p>These big, substantial cats are the biggest of their kind and are tougher and more durable than their feline\r\n        kin. If you want to play a Maine Coon, a Norwegian Forest Cat or just an unusually chunky version of your\r\n        favorite breed, choose a Large Cat!</p>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Gain +1 to your Strength attribute</p>\r\n\r\n      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n      <h6>Regular Cat</h6>\r\n      <p>The typical cat. Neither too large, nor too small. Purrfect, you might say. Play a medium cat if you want to be\r\n        a tabby, a bengal or an American bobtail; you're the kind of cat who knows how the world works. You can live in\r\n        a home, or in the wild.</p>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Gain +1 to your Wisdom attribute</p>\r\n\r\n      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n      <h6>Lap Cat</h6>\r\n      <p>Smaller, more delicate and all the smarter for it, Lap Cats are experts at getting others to do the work for\r\n        them. After all, when you're this adorable, why wouldn't you? Play a lap cat if you want to be a Persian, a\r\n        sphynx or a ragdoll - or if you just want to be small, cute and loveable.</p>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Gain +1 to your Charisma attribute</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <!-- End collapseStats -->\r\n    <!-- Start collapseLore -->\r\n    <div class=\"collapse rounded\" id=\"collapseLore\">\r\n\r\n      <h4>Cat Abilities</h4>\r\n      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">How Did They Get Up There?:</span> Moving with preternatural speed and grace, you\r\n        scramble up sheer surfaces with ease. Reduce the difficulty of all climb tests by 2.</p>\r\n      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Feline Intuition:</span> You know things. Even if you're not entirely sure how\r\n        sometimes, you just do... Gain +1 to INT score permanently.</p>\r\n      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Gone!:</span> No thanks, you're not sticking around to be smashed with a mace. You know\r\n        how to stay safe and stay alive. When fleeing or escaping from combat, double your Base Speed.</p>\r\n      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Attention must be Paid!:</span> Are they...ignoring you? Have they seen what you look\r\n        like? Well, you'll soon put a stop to that. Add Proficiency bonus to all Charisma checks.</p>\r\n      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Skilled Hunter:</span> You can follow your prey through any terrain, no one is getting\r\n        away from you! Add +2 to all Tracking rolls.</p>\r\n      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Action Cat:</span> You're always ready for what comes next; you're poised, cunning and\r\n        able to anticipate. Add +1 to your Initiative Modifier.</p>\r\n      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Like Smoke:</span> The enemy flails about them, trying to hit you. But you've already\r\n        gone, like mist in a strong breeze. Whenever attempting to move past an enemy, or disengage from combat, you may\r\n        avoid the first Attack of Opportunity made by an enemy.</p>\r\n      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Flower Marked:</span> Your distinctive patterned fur is actually highly effective\r\n        camouflage, making you difficult to spot in the wilderness. You have advantage on all stealth rolls made in\r\n        natural terrain, like forest or jungle.</p>\r\n      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Lands on Feet:</span> You are incredibly agile, so much so that even falling from a\r\n        great height seems to scarcely affect you. Whenever you take fall damage, it is halved.</p>\r\n      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Good Luck Cat:</span> You're just...lucky! You don't know why, but you are. Once per\r\n        session, you may reroll one failed test.</p>\r\n      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Life in the Shadows:</span> Twilight is your element, your coloring and lithe form\r\n        making you almost impossible to track as the light dims. Whenever you are in partial or reduced light, you gain\r\n        a +2 to all stealth roles.</p>\r\n      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Like a Wolf:</span> As you shed your fur, you begin to resemble a vicious wolf, teeth\r\n        bared and hungry for blood. You know how to use this appearance to your own ends! Whenever making an Intimidate\r\n        check, you may use your proficiency bonus on top of any other modifiers.</p>\r\n      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Big Unit:</span> Hulking and mighty, it doesn't matter that you aren't as big as a\r\n        Dragon...you pack just as much into a smaller package! Add +1 to your strength attribute.</p>\r\n      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Defensive Fluff:</span> Your fun is spectacularly fluffy, softening the blows of your\r\n        enemies and protecting you against whatever forces you must confront. Add +1 to your Armor Class.</p>\r\n      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Adaptation:</span> You were born in freezing cold conditions, you're used to them,\r\n        capable of putting up with anything. You are Resistant to Cold Damage.</p>\r\n      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Go Limp:</span> You're spent a lot of time going limp and playing dead. You're eerily\r\n        good at it, in fact, but you're learned something more while lying there, unmoving. When knocked Prone, you\r\n        suffer no disadvantages to avoiding or evading attacks.</p>\r\n      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Everybody Wants to be a Cat:</span> You know it's natural to envy your grace, your fur,\r\n        your beauty. How could they not? They won't get close , of course, but they can always watch you. Add +1 to your\r\n        Charisma Attribute.</p>\r\n      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">And... Push: Things need pushing!:</span> That's what they're there for! Just give them\r\n        a little nudge and see what happens! Whenever attempting to move a stationary object, you may add your\r\n        Proficiency bonus to the roll.</p>\r\n      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Stubborn:</span> You don't go down. You've been in a lot of fights and you don't like\r\n        losing. You don't lime doing anything unless you want to do it. When you're reduced to 0 hit points in combat,\r\n        make a DC 14 Constitution save. If you succeed, you are not knocked unconscious but remain standing, on 1 hit\r\n        point. This ability can be used once per combat.</p>\r\n      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Light Sleeper:</span> You don't need much in the way of recovery time. You can get by\r\n        in a way others can't. When Short Resting, determine the number of hit points regained in the normal fashion\r\n        (roll a Hit Dice and add the COnstitution modifier), then add an additional 1d4+2 hit points to the total.</p>\r\n      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Slippery Customer:</span> Someone with your dignity is, most assuredly, not going to be\r\n        manhandled! Whenever an enemy attempts to grapple you, you make your opposing Dexterity roll at Advantage.</p>\r\n      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n      <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Nine Lives:</span> Everyone knows that cats are too fast for death to catch. You make\r\n        all saves at Advantage.</p>\r\n\r\n      <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n      <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary\" onclick=\"goToTop()\">Back to Top</button>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  <!-- End collapseLore -->\r\n\r\n  <footer class=\"page-footer font-small blue fixed-bottom\">\r\n    <p>&copy; Chad Oswald | <a href=\"mailto:chadloswald@gmail.com\">chadloswald@gmail.com</a></p>\r\n  </footer>\r\n\r\n  <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js\"\r\n    integrity=\"sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo\"\r\n    crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\r\n  <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/popper.js@1.14.7/dist/umd/popper.min.js\"\r\n    integrity=\"sha384-UO2eT0CpHqdSJQ6hJty5KVphtPhzWj9WO1clHTMGa3JDZwrnQq4sF86dIHNDz0W1\"\r\n    crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\r\n  <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.3.1/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js\"\r\n    integrity=\"sha384-JjSmVgyd0p3pXB1rRibZUAYoIIy6OrQ6VrjIEaFf/nJGzIxFDsf4x0xIM+B07jRM\"\r\n    crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\r\n  <script src=\"../../scriptMon.js\"></script>\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>"
