# MonsterGuide

In this project, I'm building a mobile-first website using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Bootstrap, tailored for Dungeons and Dragons players. It offers a user-friendly platform to explore Bestiary information and will expand to include more game tools. Through this, I'm improving my mobile design skills while creating something fun and useful for the gaming community.
