Charm Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the beholder for 1 hour, or until the beholder harms the creature.</p>\r\n+            <p><em>2. Paralyzing Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute.

Fear Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>\r\n+            <p><em>4.

In addition, the creature can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect 0n itself on a success.</p>\r\n+            <p><em>5.

Telekinetic Ray:</em> If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or the beholder moves it up to 30 feet in any direction. It is restrained by the ray's telekinetic grip until the start of the beholder's next turn or until the beholder is incapacitated.</p>\r\n+                <p>If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 feet in any direction. The beholder can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.</p>\r\n+            <p><em>7. Sleep Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious for 1 minute . The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.</p>\r\n+            <p><em>8. Petrification Ray:</em> The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained.

Charm Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the beholder for 1 hour, or until the beholder harms the creature.</p>\r\n-            <p><em>2. Paralyzing Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>\r\n-            <p><em>3. Fear Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>\r\n-            <p><em>4. Slowing Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute . In addition, the creature can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect 0n itself on a success.</p>\r\n-            <p><em>5. Enervation Ray:</em> The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\r\n-            <p><em>6. Telekinetic Ray:</em> If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or the beholder moves it up to 30 feet in any direction. It is restrained by the ray's telekinetic grip until the start of the beholder's next turn or until the beholder is incapacitated.</p>\r\n-                <p>If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 feet in any direction. The beholder can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.</p>\r\n-            <p><em>7. Sleep Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious for 1 minute . The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.</p>\r\n-            <p><em>8. Petrification Ray:</em> The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.</p>\r\n-            <p><em>9. Disintegration Ray:</em> If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust.</p>\r\n-                <p>If the target is a Large or smaller non magical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw.

Even chaotic good deities command lawful\r\n               good angels, knowing that the angels' dedication to order best allows them to fulfill divine commands. An\r\n               angel follows a single driving purpose, as decreed by its deity. However, an angel is incapable of\r\n               following commands that stray from the path of law and good.</p>\r\n            <p>An angel slays evil creatures without remorse. As the embodiment of law and good, an angel is almost\r\n               never mistaken in its judgments. This quality can create a sense of superiority in an angel, a sense that\r\n               comes to the fore when an angel's task conflicts with the goals of another creature. The angel never\r\n               acquiesces or gives way. When an angel is sent to aid mortals, it is sent not to serve but to command.\r\n               The gods of good therefore send their angels among mortals only in response to the most dire\r\n               circumstances.</p>\r\n         </div>\r\n         <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n         <div id=\"fallenAngels\">\r\n            <h5>Fallen Angels</h5>\r\n            <p>An angel's moral compass grants it a sense of infallibility that can sometimes spell its undoing. Angels\r\n               are usually too wise to fall for a simple deception, but sometimes pride can lead one to commit an evil\r\n               act. Whether intentional or accidental, such an act is a permanent stain that marks the angel as an\r\n               outcast.</p>\r\n            <p>Fallen angels retain their power but lose their connection to the deities from which they were made. Most\r\n               fallen angels take their banishment personally, rebelling against the powers they served by seeking\r\n               rulership over a section of the Abyss or a place among other fallen in the hierarchy of the Nine Hells.\r\n               Zariel, the ruler of the first layer of the Nine Hells, is such a creature. Rather than rebel, some\r\n               fallen angels resign themselves to an isolated existence on the Material Plane, living in disguise as\r\n               simple hermits. If they are redeemed, they can become powerful allies dedicated to justice and\r\n               compassionate service.</p>\r\n         </div>\r\n         <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n         <div id=\"immortalNature\">\r\n            <h5>Immortal Nature</h5>\r\n            <p>An angel doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.</p>\r\n         </div>\r\n         <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n         <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary\" onclick=\"goToTop()\">Back to Top</button>\r\n      </div>\r\n   </div>\r\n   <!-- End collapseLore -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   <footer class=\"page-footer font-small blue fixed-bottom\">\r\n      <p>&copy; Chad Oswald | <a href=\"mailto:chadloswald@gmail.com\">chadloswald@gmail.com</a></p>\r\n   </footer>\r\n\r\n   <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js\"\r\n      integrity=\"sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo\"\r\n      crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\r\n   <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/popper.js@1.14.7/dist/umd/popper.min.js\"\r\n      integrity=\"sha384-UO2eT0CpHqdSJQ6hJty5KVphtPhzWj9WO1clHTMGa3JDZwrnQq4sF86dIHNDz0W1\"\r\n      crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\r\n   <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.3.1/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js\"\r\n      integrity=\"sha384-JjSmVgyd0p3pXB1rRibZUAYoIIy6OrQ6VrjIEaFf/nJGzIxFDsf4x0xIM+B07jRM\"\r\n      crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\r\n   <script src=\"../../script.js\"></script>\r\n</body><!-- JavaScript to load navbar -->
