In addition, the creature can't take reactions,\r\n-                and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both.

It is restrained by the ray's telekinetic\r\n-                grip until the start of the tyrant's next turn or until the tyrant is incapacitated.</p>\r\n-            <p>If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up\r\n-                to 30 feet in any direction.

Sleep Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep\r\n-                and remain unconscious for 1 minute . The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an\r\n-                action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.</p>\r\n-            <p><em>8. Petrification Ray:</em> The targeted creature must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a\r\n-                failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at\r\n-                the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until\r\n-                freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.</p>\r\n-            <p><em>9. Disintegration Ray:</em> If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving\r\n-                throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body\r\n-                becomes a pile of fine gray dust.</p>\r\n-            <p>If the target is a Large or smaller non magical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated\r\n-                without a saving throw.

Death Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 55\r\n-                (10d10) necrotic damage.

Hit: 14\r\n                (4d6) <span class="tip" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Piercing damage represents the physical harm caused by a sharp object piercing through a target's defenses" style="text-decoration: underline;">piercing damage</span>.</p>\r\n            <p><span class=\"bold-text\">Eye Rays:</span> The death tyrant shoots three of the following magical eye rays\r\n                at\r\n                random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within 120 feet of it:</p>\r\n            <p><em>1. Charm Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by\r\n                the tyrant for 1 hour, or until the beholder harms the creature.</p>\r\n            <p><em>2. Paralyzing Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be\r\n                paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending\r\n                the effect on itself on a success.</p>\r\n            <p><em>3. Fear Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened\r\n                for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect\r\n                on itself on a success.</p>\r\n            <p><em>4. Slowing Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a\r\n                failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute . In addition, the creature can't take reactions,\r\n                and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the\r\n                saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect 0n itself on a success.</p>\r\n            <p><em>5. Enervation Ray:</em> The targeted creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 36\r\n                (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\r\n            <p><em>6. Telekinetic Ray:</em> If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving\r\n                throw or the beholder moves it up to 30 feet in any direction. It is restrained by the ray's telekinetic\r\n                grip until the start of the tyrant's next turn or until the tyrant is incapacitated.</p>\r\n            <p>If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up\r\n                to 30 feet in any direction. The tyrant can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as\r\n                manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.</p>\r\n            <p><em>7. Sleep Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep\r\n                and remain unconscious for 1 minute . The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an\r\n                action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.</p>\r\n            <p><em>8. Petrification Ray:</em> The targeted creature must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a\r\n                failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at\r\n                the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until\r\n                freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.</p>\r\n            <p><em>9. Disintegration Ray:</em> If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving\r\n                throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body\r\n                becomes a pile of fine gray dust.</p>\r\n            <p>If the target is a Large or smaller non magical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated\r\n                without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this ray\r\n                disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.</p>\r\n            <p><em>10. Death Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 55\r\n                (10d10) necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points.</p>\r\n\r\n            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n            <h5>Legendary Actions</h5>\r\n            <p>The death tyrant can take 3 legendary actions, using the Eye Ray option below.
