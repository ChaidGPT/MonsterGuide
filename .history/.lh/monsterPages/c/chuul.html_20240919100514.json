Its dragon head drives it to raid, plunder, and accumulate a great hoard. Its leonine nature compels it to hunt and kill powerful creatures that threaten its territory. Its goat head grants it a vicious, stubborn streak that compels it to fight to the death.</p>\r\n                <p>These three aspects drive a chimera to stake out a territory that is as large as 10 miles wide. It preys on wild game, viewing more powerful creatures as rivals to be humiliated and defeated. Its greatest rivals are dragons, griffons, manticores, perytons, and wyverns.</p>\r\n                <p>When it hunts, the chimera looks for easy ways to amuse itself. It enjoys the fear and suffering of weaker creatures. The monster often toys with its prey, breaking off an attack prematurely and leaving a creature wounded and terrified before returning to finish it off.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n            <div id=\"servantOfEvil\">\r\n                <h5>Servant of Evil</h5>\r\n                <p>Though chimeras are far from cunning, their draconic ego makes them susceptible to flattery and gifts.
