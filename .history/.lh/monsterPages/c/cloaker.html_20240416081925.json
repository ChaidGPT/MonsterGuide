In those days, the aboleths used mighty magic and bent the minds of the nascent creatures of the mortal realm.

Therefore, they created chuuls.</p>\r\n                <p>Perfectly obedient, the chuuls collected sentient creatures and magic at the aboleths' command. Chuuls were designed to endure the ages of the world, growing in size and strength as the eons passed. When the aboleths' empire crumbled with the rise of the gods, the chuuls were cast adrift. However, these creatures continue to do what they did for the aboleths, slowly collecting humanoids, gathering treasure, amassing magic, and consolidating power.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n            <div id=\"tirelessGuardians\">\r\n                <h5>Tireless Guardians</h5>\r\n                <p>Chuul still guard the ruins of the ancient aboleth empire.
