It’s worth thinking about how these characteristics reflect the character you have in mind.</p>\r\n                      <div class=\"light-horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n                      <h6>Name</h6>\r\n                      <p>Your character’s race description includes sample names for members of that race. Put some thought into your name even if you’re just picking one from a list.</p>\r\n                      <div class=\"light-horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n                      <h6>Sex</h6>\r\n                      <p>You can play any gender of character without gaining any special benefits or hindrances. Think about how your character does or does not conform to the broader culture’s expectations of sex, gender, and sexual behavior. For example, a male drow cleric defies the traditional gender divisions of drow society, which could be a reason for your character to leave that society and come to the surface.</p>\r\n                      <p>You don’t need to be confined to binary notions of sex and gender. The elf god Corellon Larethian is often seen as androgynous or hermaphroditic, for example, and some elves in the multiverse are made in Corellon’s image. You could also play a female character who presents herself as a man, a man who feels trapped in a female body, or a bearded female dwarf who hates being mistaken for a male. Likewise, your character’s sexual orientation is for you to decide.</p>\r\n                      <div class=\"light-horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n                      <h6>Height and Weight</h6>\r\n                      <p>You can decide your character’s height and weight, using the information provided in your race description or on the Random Height and Weight table. Think about what your character’s ability scores might say about his or her height and weight. A weak but agile character might be thin. A strong and tough character might be tall or just heavy.</p>\r\n                      <p>If you want to, you can roll randomly for your character’s height and weight using the Random Height and Weight table. The dice roll given in the Height Modifier colum n determines the character’s extra height (in inches) beyond the base height.

Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.</p>\r\n                      <p>These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.</p>\r\n                      <p><span class=\"underline-text\">Lawful Good:</span> (LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins, and most dwarves are lawful good.</p>\r\n                      <p><span class=\"underline-text\">Neutral Good:</span> (NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many celestials, some cloud giants, and most gnomes are neutral good.</p>\r\n                      <p><span class=\"underline-text\">Chaotic Good:</span> (CG) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good.</p>\r\n                      <p><span class=\"underline-text\">Lawful Neutral:</span> (LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some wizards are lawful neutral.</p>\r\n                      <p><span class=\"underline-text\">Neutral:</span> (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don’t take sides,doing what seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and many humans are neutral.</p>\r\n                      <p><span class=\"underline-text\">Chaotic Neutral:</span> (CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. Many barbarians and rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral.</p>\r\n                      <p><span class=\"underline-text\">Lawful Evil:</span> (LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil.</p>\r\n                      <p><span class=\"underline-text\">Neutral Evil:</span> (NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without com passion or qualms. Many drow, some cloud giants, and yugoloths are neutral evil.</p>\r\n                      <p><span class=\"underline-text\">Chaotic Evil:</span> (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust.

Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good-aligned gods who created these races gave them free will to choose their moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery.</p>\r\n                      <p>The evil deities who created other races, though, made those races to serve them. Those races have strong inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods. Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc god, Gruumsh, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs feel the lingering pull of the orc god’s influence.)</p>\r\n                      <p>Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn’t tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a devil.</p>\r\n                      <p>Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments—they are unaligned. Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil; they have no alignment.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                  </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <!-- --------------------------------------------------------- -->\r\n                <div class=\"card\">\r\n                  <div class=\"card-header\" id=\"headingThree\">\r\n                    <h2 class=\"mb-0\">\r\n                      <button class=\"btn btn-link btn-block text-left text-dark collapsed\" type=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-target=\"#collapseThree\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapseThree\">\r\n                        Languages\r\n                      </button>\r\n                    </h2>\r\n                  </div>\r\n                  <div id=\"collapseThree\" class=\"collapse\" aria-labelledby=\"headingThree\" data-parent=\"#accordionExample\">\r\n                    <div class=\"card-body\">\r\n                      <p>Your race indicates the languages your character can speak by default, and your background might give you access to one or more additional languages of your choice.

            <p>Fleshing out your character’s personality—the array of traits, mannerisms, habits, beliefs, and flaws that give a person a unique identity—will help you bring him or her to life as you play the game. Four categories of characteristics are presented here: personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories, think about your character’s favorite words or phrases, tics and habitual gestures, vices and pet peeves, and whatever else you can imagine</p>\r\n                      <p>Each background presented later in this chapter includes suggested characteristics that you can use to spark your imagination. You’re not bound to those options, but they’re a good starting point.</p>\r\n                      <div class=\"light-horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n                      <h6>Personality Traits</h6>\r\n                      <p>Give your character two personality traits. Personality traits are small, simple ways to help you set your character apart from every other character. Your personality traits should tell you something interesting and fun about your character. They should be self-descriptions that are specific about what makes your character stand out. “I’m smart” is not a good trait, because it describes a lot of characters. “I’ve read every book in Candlekeep” tells you something specific about your character’s interests and disposition.</p>\r\n                      <p>Personality traits might describe the things your character likes, his or her past accomplishments, things your character dislikes or fears, your character’s self-attitude or mannerisms, or the influence of his or her ability scores.</p>\r\n                      <p>A useful place to start thinking about personality traits is to look at your highest and lowest ability scores and define one trait related to each. Either one could be positive or negative: you might work hard to overcome a low score, for example, or be cocky about your high score.</p>\r\n                      <div class=\"light-horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n                      <h6>Ideals</h6>\r\n                      <p>Describe one ideal that drives your character. Your ideals are the things that you believe in m ost strongly, the fundamental moral and ethical principles that com pel you to act as you do. Ideals encompass everything from your life goals to your core belief system</p>\r\n                      <p>Ideals might answer any of these questions: What are the principles that you will never betray? What would prompt you to make sacrifices? What drives you to act and guides your goals and ambitions? What is the single most important thing you strive for?</p>\r\n                      <p>You can choose any ideals you like, but your character’s alignment is a good place to start defining them. Each background in this chapter includes six suggested ideals. Five of them are linked to aspects of alignment: law, chaos, good, evil, and neutrality. The last one has more to do with the particular background than with moral or ethical perspectives.</p>\r\n                      <div class=\"light-horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n                      <h6>Bonds</h6>\r\n                      <p>Create one bond for your character. Bonds represent a character’s connections to people, places, and events in the world. They tie you to things from your background. They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead you to act against your own best interests if they are threatened. They can work very much like ideals, driving a character’s motivations and goals.</p>\r\n                      <p>Bonds might answer any of these questions: Whom do you care most about? To what place do you feel a special connection? What is your most treasured possession?</p>\r\n                      <p>Your bonds might be tied to your class, your background, your race, or some other aspect of your character’s history or personality. You might also gain new bonds over the course of your adventures</p>\r\n                      <div class=\"light-horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n                      <h6>Flaws</h6>\r\n                      <p>Finally, choose a flaw for your character. Your character’s flaw represents some vice, compulsion, fear, or weakness—in particular, anything that someone else could exploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to act against your best interests. More significant than negative personality traits, a flaw might answer any of these questions: What enrages you? What’s the one person, concept, or event that you are terrified of? What are your vices?</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                  </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n<!-- --------------------------------------------------------- -->\r\n<div class=\"card\">\r\n  <div class=\"card-header\" id=\"headingFive\">\r\n    <h2 class=\"mb-0\">\r\n      <button class=\"btn btn-link btn-block text-left text-dark collapsed\" type=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-target=\"#collapseFive\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapseTwo\">\r\n        Inspiration\r\n      </button>\r\n    </h2>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div id=\"collapseFive\" class=\"collapse\" aria-labelledby=\"headingFive\" data-parent=\"#accordionExample\">\r\n    <div class=\"card-body\">\r\n      <p>Inspiration is a rule the Dungeon Master can use to reward you for playing your character in a way that’s true to his or her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw. By using inspiration, you can draw on your personality trait of compassion for the downtrodden to give you an edge in negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or inspiration can let you call on your bond to the defense of your home village to push past the effect of a spell that has been laid on you.</p>\r\n      <div class=\"light-horizontal-line\"></div>\r\n      <h6>Gaining Inspiration</h6>\r\n      <p>Your DM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety of reasons. Typically, DMs award it when you play out your personality traits, give in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your character in a compelling way. Your DM will tell you how you can earn inspiration in the game.</p>\r\n      <p>You either have inspiration or you don’t—you can’t stockpile multiple “inspirations” for later use.</p>\r\n      <h6>Using Inspiration</h6>\r\n      <p>If you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending your inspiration gives you advantage on that roll.</p>\r\n      <p>Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply doing something exciting in the game. When another player character does something that really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can give up your inspiration to give that character inspiration.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n              \r\n              </div>\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n  <footer class=\"page-footer font-small blue\">\r\n    <p>&copy; Chad Oswald | <a href=\"mailto:chadloswald@gmail.com\">chadloswald@gmail.com</a> |<a\r\n                href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chad-oswald-994a8b1b3/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"LinkedIn Profile\">\r\n                <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" fill=\"currentColor\"\r\n                    class=\"bi bi-linkedin icon\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\">\r\n                    <path\r\n                        d=\"M0 1.146C0 .513.526 0 1.175 0h13.65C15.474 0 16 .513 16 1.146v13.708c0 .633-.526 1.146-1.175 1.146H1.175C.526 16 0 15.487 0 14.854zm4.943 12.248V6.169H2.542v7.225zm-1.2-8.212c.837 0 1.358-.554 1.358-1.248-.015-.709-.52-1.248-1.342-1.248S2.4 3.226 2.4 3.934c0 .694.521 1.248 1.327 1.248zm4.908 8.212V9.359c0-.216.016-.432.08-.586.173-.431.568-.878 1.232-.878.869 0 1.216.662 1.216 1.634v3.865h2.401V9.25c0-2.22-1.184-3.252-2.764-3.252-1.274 0-1.845.7-2.165 1.193v.025h-.016l.016-.025V6.169h-2.4c.03.678 0 7.225 0 7.225z\" />\r\n                </svg>\r\n            </a></p>\r\n  </footer>\r\n    <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js\"\r\n        integrity=\"sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo\"\r\n        crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\r\n    <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/popper.js@1.14.7/dist/umd/popper.min.js\"\r\n        integrity=\"sha384-UO2eT0CpHqdSJQ6hJty5KVphtPhzWj9WO1clHTMGa3JDZwrnQq4sF86dIHNDz0W1\"\r\n        crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\r\n    <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.3.1/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js\"\r\n        integrity=\"sha384-JjSmVgyd0p3pXB1rRibZUAYoIIy6OrQ6VrjIEaFf/nJGzIxFDsf4x0xIM+B07jRM\"\r\n        crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>"
