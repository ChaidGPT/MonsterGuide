        <p class="lead text-center">Large monstrosity, lawful evil</p>
        <p>On rare occasions, a beholder's sleeping mind drifts to places beyond its normal madness, imagining a reality in which it exists beyond death. When such dreams take hold, a beholder can transform, its flesh sloughing away to leave a death tyrant behind. This monster possesses the cunning and much of the magic it had in life, but it is fueled by the power of undeath.</p>
        <p>A death tyrant appears as a massive, naked skull, with a pinpoint of red light gleaming in its hollow eye socket. With its eyestalks rotted away, ten spectral eyes hover above the creature and glare in all directions.</p>

            <p>Any creature in that area can't regain hit points. Any humanoid that dies there becomes a zombie under the tyrant's command. The dead humanoid retains its place in the initiative order and animates at the start of its next turn, provided that its body hasn't been completely destroyed.</p>

            <h5>Actions</h5>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Bite:</span> Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14
                (4d6) piercing damage.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Eye Rays:</span> The death tyrant shoots three of the following magical eye rays at
                random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within 120 feet of it:</p>
            <p><em>1. Charm Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by
                the tyrant for 1 hour, or until the beholder harms the creature.</p>
            <p><em>2. Paralyzing Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be
                paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
                the effect on itself on a success.</p>
            <p><em>3. Fear Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened
                for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect
                on itself on a success.</p>
            <p><em>4. Slowing Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a
                failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute . In addition, the creature can't take reactions,
                and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the
                saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect 0n itself on a success.</p>
            <p><em>5. Enervation Ray:</em> The targeted creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 36
                (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
            <p><em>6. Telekinetic Ray:</em> If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving
                throw or the beholder moves it up to 30 feet in any direction. It is restrained by the ray's telekinetic
                grip until the start of the tyrant's next turn or until the tyrant is incapacitated.</p>
            <p>If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up
                to 30 feet in any direction. The tyrant can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as
                manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.</p>
            <p><em>7. Sleep Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep
                and remain unconscious for 1 minute . The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an
                action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.</p>
            <p><em>8. Petrification Ray:</em> The targeted creature must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a
                failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at
                the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until
                freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.</p>
            <p><em>9. Disintegration Ray:</em> If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving
                throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body
                becomes a pile of fine gray dust.</p>
            <p>If the target is a Large or smaller non magical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated
                without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this ray
                disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.</p>
            <p><em>10. Death Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 55
                (10d10) necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points.</p>

                <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <h5>Legendary Actions</h5>
            <p>The death tyrant can take 3 legendary actions, using the Eye Ray option below. It can take only one legendary
                action at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn . The beholder regains spent legendary
                actions at the start of its turn.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Eye Ray:</span> The death tyrant uses one random eye ray.</p>

                <h5>Adaptable Predators</h5>
                <p>Basilisks thrive in arid, temperate, or tropical climates. They lair in caves or other sheltered
                    sites. Most often, basilisks are encountered underground.</p>
                <p>A basilisk born and raised in captivity can be domesticated and trained. Such a trained basilisk
                    knows how to avoid meeting the eyes of those its master wishes to protect from its gaze, but it
                    makes a daunting guardian beast. Because of this use, basilisk eggs are highly prized.</p>

                <h5>Gaze of Stone</h5>
                <p>Basilisks are ponderous for hunting creatures, but they needn't chase prey. Meeting a basilisk's
                    supernatural gaze can be enough to affect a rapid transformation, transforming a victim into porous
                    stone. Basilisks, with their strong jaws, are able to consume the stone. The stone returns to
                    organic form in the basilisk's gullet.</p>
                <p>Some alchemists are said to know how to process the basilisk's gullet and the fluids contained
                    within. Properly handled, the gullet produces an oil that can return petrified creatures to flesh
                    and life. Unfortunately for such a victim, any parts lost in stone form remain absent if the
                    creature revives. Revivification using the oil is impossible if a vital part of the petrified
                    creature, such as its head, is detached.</p>
