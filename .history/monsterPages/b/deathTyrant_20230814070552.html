        <p class="lead text-center">Large monstrosity, lawful evil</p>
        <p>On rare occasions, a beholder's sleeping mind drifts to places beyond its normal madness, imagining a reality
            in which it exists beyond death. When such dreams take hold, a beholder can transform, its flesh sloughing
            away to leave a death tyrant behind. This monster possesses the cunning and much of the magic it had in
            life, but it is fueled by the power of undeath.</p>
        <p>A death tyrant appears as a massive, naked skull, with a pinpoint of red light gleaming in its hollow eye
            socket. With its eyestalks rotted away, ten spectral eyes hover above the creature and glare in all
            directions.</p>

                magical150-foot cone of negative energy. At the start of each of its turns, the tyrant decides which way
                the cone faces and whether the cone is active.</p>
            <p>Any creature in that area can't regain hit points. Any humanoid that dies there becomes a zombie under
                the tyrant's command. The dead humanoid retains its place in the initiative order and animates at the
                start of its next turn, provided that its body hasn't been completely destroyed.</p>
            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <h5>Actions</h5>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Bite:</span> Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14
                (4d6) piercing damage.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Eye Rays:</span> The death tyrant shoots three of the following magical eye rays
                at
                random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within 120 feet of it:</p>
            <p><em>1. Charm Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by
                the tyrant for 1 hour, or until the beholder harms the creature.</p>
            <p><em>2. Paralyzing Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be
                paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
                the effect on itself on a success.</p>
            <p><em>3. Fear Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened
                for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect
                on itself on a success.</p>
            <p><em>4. Slowing Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a
                failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute . In addition, the creature can't take reactions,
                and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the
                saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect 0n itself on a success.</p>
            <p><em>5. Enervation Ray:</em> The targeted creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 36
                (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
            <p><em>6. Telekinetic Ray:</em> If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving
                throw or the beholder moves it up to 30 feet in any direction. It is restrained by the ray's telekinetic
                grip until the start of the tyrant's next turn or until the tyrant is incapacitated.</p>
            <p>If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up
                to 30 feet in any direction. The tyrant can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as
                manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.</p>
            <p><em>7. Sleep Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep
                and remain unconscious for 1 minute . The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an
                action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.</p>
            <p><em>8. Petrification Ray:</em> The targeted creature must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a
                failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at
                the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until
                freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.</p>
            <p><em>9. Disintegration Ray:</em> If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving
                throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body
                becomes a pile of fine gray dust.</p>
            <p>If the target is a Large or smaller non magical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated
                without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this ray
                disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.</p>
            <p><em>10. Death Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 55
                (10d10) necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points.</p>

            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <h5>Legendary Actions</h5>
            <p>The death tyrant can take 3 legendary actions, using the Eye Ray option below. It can take only one
                legendary
                action at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn . The beholder regains spent legendary
                actions at the start of its turn.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Eye Ray:</span> The death tyrant uses one random eye ray.</p>

                <h5>Deathly Despot</h5>
                <p>As they did when they were beholders, death tyrants lord their power over other creatures. Moreover,
                    a beholder's ability to quash magical energy with its central eye gives way to a more sinister power
                    in a death tyrant, which can transform former slaves and enemies into undead servants.</p>
                <p>Zombies created by a death tyrant are used and discarded as needed. They stand guard at the entrances
                    to the death tyrant's lair or guard its treasure vaults. Acting as bait for traps or as combat
                    fodder, Zombies keep powerful enemies distracted while the death tyrant moves into position and
                    prepares to destroy them.</p>

                <h5>Armies of the Dead</h5>
                <p>A death tyrant that embraces undeath becomes an engine of destruction. Driven by a hunger for power
                    and security, it advances against humanoid settlements, using its eye rays to destroy every creature
                    it encounters, then building an army of undead. If left unchecked, a death tyrant might wipe out the
                    population of a city in weeks, then set its undead eye on wider conquest. As each settlement falls,
                    the death tyrant's zombie forces build to overwhelming numbers.</p>

                <h5>A Death Tyrant's Lair</h5>
                <p>A death tyrant's lair is usually the same site it held as a death tyrant's, but it contains more
                    trappings of death and decay. A death tyrant encountered in its lair has a challenge rating of 15
                    (13,000 XP).</p>
                <p><span class="bold-text">Lair Actions:</span>When fighting inside its lair, a death tyrant can invoke
                    the
                    ambient magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the death
                    tyrant
                    can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects:</p>
                <p>- An area that is a 50-foot cube within 120 feet of the tyrant is filled with spectral eyes and
                    tentacles. To creatures other than the death tyrant, that area is lightly obscured and difficult
                    terrain until initiative count 20 on the next round.</p>
                <p>- Walls sprout spectral appendages until initiative count 20 on the round after next. Any creature,
                    including one on the Ethereal Plane, that is hostile to the tyrant and starts its turn within 10
                    feet of a wall must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled. Escaping requires a
                    successful DC 17 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.</p>
                <p>- tyrant shoots from that eye, which is considered to be an ethereal source, at a target of the
                    tyrant's choice. The eye then closes and disappears.</p>
                <p>The death tyrant can't repeat an effect until all three have been used, and it can't use the same
                    effect on consecutive rounds.</p>
                <p><span class="bold-text">Reginal Effects:</span>A region containing a death tyrant's lair is warped by
                    the
                    creature's' unnatural presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
                <p>- Creatures within 1 mile of the tyrant's lair sometimes feel as if they're being watched even when
                    they aren't.</p>
                <p>- When a creature hostile to the tyrant and aware of its existence finishes a long rest within 1 mile
                    of the tyrant's lair, roll a d20 for that creature. On a roll of 10 or lower, the creature is
                    subjected to one random eye ray of the tyrant.</p>
                <p>If the death tyrant dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.</p>
