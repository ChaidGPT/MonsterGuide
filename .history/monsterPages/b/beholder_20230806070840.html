        <p>One glance at a beholder is enough to assess its foul and otherworldly nature. Aggressive, hateful, and
            greedy, these aberrations dismiss all other creatures as lesser beings, toying with them or destroying them
            as they choose.</p>
        <p>A beholder's spheroid body levitates at all times, and it's great bulging eye sits above a wide, toothy maw,
            while the smaller eyestalks that crown its body twist and turn to keep its foes in sight. When a beholder
            sleeps, it closes its central eye but leaves its smaller eyes open and alert.</p>

                as in the anti magic field spell, in a 150-foot cone. At the start of each of its turns, the beholder
                decides which way the cone faces and whether the cone is active. The area works against the beholder's
                own eye rays.</p>

                (4d6) piercing damage.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Eye Rays:</span> The beholder shoots three of the following magical eye rays at
                random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within 120 feet of it:</p>
            <p><em>1. Charm Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by
                the beholder for 1 hour, or until the beholder harms the creature.</p>
            <p><em>2. Paralyzing Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be
                paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
                the effect on itself on a success.</p>
            <p><em>3. Fear Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened
                for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect
                on itself on a success.</p>
            <p><em>4. Slowing Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a
                failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute . In addition, the creature can't take reactions,
                and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the
                saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect 0n itself on a success.</p>
            <p><em>5. Enervation Ray:</em> The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 36
                (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
            <p><em>6. Telekinetic Ray:</em> If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving
                throw or the beholder moves it up to 30 feet in any direction. It is restrained by the ray's telekinetic
                grip until the start of the beholder's next turn or until the beholder is incapacitated.</p>
            <p>If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up
                to 30 feet in any direction. The beholder can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as
                manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.</p>
            <p><em>7. Sleep Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep
                and remain unconscious for 1 minute . The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an
                action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.</p>
            <p><em>8. Petrification Ray:</em> The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a
                failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at
                the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until
                freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.</p>
            <p><em>9. Disintegration Ray:</em> If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving
                throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body
                becomes a pile of fine gray dust.</p>
            <p>If the target is a Large or smaller non magical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated
                without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this ray
                disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.</p>
            <p><em>10. Death Ray:</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 55
                (10d10) necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points.</p>

            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <h5>Legendary Actions</h5>
            <p>The beholder can take 3 legendary actions, using the Eye Ray option below. It can take only one legendary
                action at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn . The beholder regains spent legendary
                actions at the start of its turn.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Eye Ray:</span> The beholder uses one random eye ray.</p>

                <h5>Xenophobic Isolationists</h5>
                <p>Enemies abound, or so every beholder believes. Beholders are convinced that other creatures resent them for their brilliance and magical power, even as they dismiss those lesser creatures as crude and disgusting. Beholders always suspect others of plotting against them, even when no other creatures are around.</p>
                <p>The disdain a beholder has for other creatures extends to other beholders. Each beholder believes its form to be an ideal, and that any deviation from that form is a flaw in the racial purity of its kind. Beholders vary greatly in their physical forms, making conflict between them inevitable. Some beholders are protected by overlapping chitinous plates. Some have smooth hides. Some have eyestalks that writhe like tentacles, while others' stalks bear crustacean-like joints. Even slight differences of coloration in hide can turn two beholders into lifelong enemies.</p>

            <div id="eyeTyrant">
                <h5>Eye Tyrant</h5>
                <p>Some beholders manage to channel their xenophobic tendencies into a terrible despotism. Rather than live in isolation, the aptly named eye tyrants enslave those other creatures, founding and controlling vast empires. An eye tyrant sometimes carves out a domain within or under a major city, commanding networks of agents that operate on their master's behalf.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="alienLair">
                <h5>Alien Lair</h5>
                <p>Because they refuse to share territory with others, most beholders withdraw to frigid hills, abandoned ruins, and deep caverns to scheme. A beholder's lair is carved out by its disintegration eye ray, emphasizing vertical passages connecting chambers stacked on top of each other. Such an environment allows a beholder to move freely, even as it prevents intruders from easily creeping about. When intruders do break in, the height of its open ceilings allows a beholder to float up and harry foes on the floor.</p>
                <p>As alien as their creator, the rooms in a beholder's lair reflect the creature's arrogance. It festoons its chambers with trophies from the battles it has won, including petrified adventurers standing frozen in their horrified final moments, pieces of other beholders, and magic items wrested from powerful foes. A beholder judges its own worth by its acquisitions, and it never willingly parts with its treasures.</p>
