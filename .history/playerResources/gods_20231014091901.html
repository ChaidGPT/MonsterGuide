            The gods that make up the pantheon of Faer&ucirc;n are much like the
            population of some of the Realms' greatest cities: an eclectic blend
            of individuals from a variety of sources. The makeup of the pantheon
            has shifted over the ages, as a result of changes in the Realms and
            its people (or vice versa, depending on which scholars you believe).
            The following describe the most prominent members of the pantheon.

                    The rule of law and the glory of the sun are both in
                    Amaunator's dominion. His priests help establish
                    bureaucracies and lawful order in communities. They often
                    witness contracts and signed agreements, stamping such
                    documents with the sun-symbol of Amaunator to signify their
                    validity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    His priests teach that Amaunator has died and been reborn
                    time and again. Like the sun, he might pass into the realm
                    of darkness, but inevitably his bright gaze will fall on the
                    world once again. Amaunator is seen as a stern and
                    unforgiving deity, not unlike Silvanus in comportment, but
                    his concern isn't for the balance of life- he cares that
                    things proceed according to the celestial order, that
                    promises are kept, and that the rule of law persists.

                  <p>
                    Farmers and travelers beseech him when they pray for rain or
                    sun, as do any others looking for a favorable change in the
                    weather. But the most common form of propitiation to
                    Amaunator is the practice of swearing oaths, signing
                    contracts, and declaring laws under the light of the sun. So
                    ingrained in the common perception is the connection between
                    a solemn oath and the sun that those engaged in closing
                    deals or issuing edicts often pause and wait for a passing
                    cloud to clear the sun before completing the transaction or
                    pronouncement.

                    Open worship of Asmodeus began roughly a century ago when
                    small cults with charismatic leaders sprang up in the
                    aftermath of the Spell plague. That catastrophe left many
                    asking why the gods were angry or had abandoned them. To
                    those questioners, the faithful of Asmodeus provided answers
                    and a god who would forgive all their faults. Still, for the
                    next few decades, the cult of Asmodeus struggled for
                    acceptance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the beliefs of the people of the North- which coincide
                    with many tales told by dwarves, elves, and others- Asmodeus
                    is Lord of the Ninth, the leader of all devils of the Nine
                    Hells. People know devils to be iron-minded and
                    silver-tongued purveyors of temptation, whose price for
                    their boons can be as dear as one's soul. It's said that
                    when a soul waits on the Fugue Plane for a deity to take it
                    to its appropriate afterlife, devils approach the soul·and
                    offer it a chance at power and immortal pleasures. All a
                    soul needs to do is take one step out of the dust and the
                    milling crowd and put a foot on the first rung of the
                    infernal ladder that represents the hierarchy of the Nine
                    Hells.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The faithful of Asmodeus acknowledge that devils offer their
                    worshipers a path that's not for everyone- just as eternally
                    basking in the light of Lathander or endlessly swinging a
                    hammer in the mines of Moradin might not be for everyone.
                    Those who serve Asmodeus in life hope to be summoned out of
                    the moaning masses of the Fugue Plane after death. They
                    yearn for the chance to master their own fates, with all of
                    eternity to achieve their goals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To those not so dedicated, priests of Asmodeus offer the
                    prospect of a reprieve in the afterlife. All souls wait on
                    the Fugue Plane for a deity's pleasure, which determines
                    where a soul will spend the rest of eternity. Those who
                    lived their lives most in keeping with a deity's outlook are
                    taken first. Others, who have transgressed in the eyes of
                    their favored god or have not followed any particular ethos,
                    might wait centuries before Kelemvor judges where they go.
                    People who fear such a fate can pray to Asmodeus, his
                    priests say, and in return a devil will grant a waiting soul
                    some comfort.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Today, shrines to Asmodeus are still rare and temples are
                    almost unheard of, but many folk have adopted the habit of
                    asking Asmodeus for reprieve from their sins. After
                    transgressing against a god in some way, a person prays to
                    Asmodeus for something to provide respite during the long
                    wait. Asmodeus is known to grant people what they wish, and
                    thus people pray for all the delights and distractions they
                    desire most from life. Those who transgress in great ways
                    often ask Asmodeus to hide their sins from the gods, and
                    priests say that he will do so, but with a price after
                    death.

                    Auril, the merciless goddess of cold and winter, is
                    worshiped mostly in regions that are affected by deep
                    winters. Folk propitiate Auril with offerings and prayers
                    for mercy. Her priests warn others to prepare for winter,
                    and to stock extra provisions in order to have some to spare
                    as offerings to the goddess.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Few favor Auril except for those who make their livelihood
                    from winter or those who truly love the season. Her rare
                    priests tend to be folk who would, but for their status,
                    likely be outcasts from their communities. They practice
                    celibacy and remain aloof from others when not serving in
                    their official capacity.

                  <p>
                    Luskan has a temple dedicated to Auril, the whitespired
                    Winter Palace. The structure is a roofless array of pillars
                    and arches carved of white stone. The rituals of Auril's
                    worship often seem cruel to outsiders. In Luskan, visitors
                    gather at the temple to watch the frequent "wet parades," a
                    ritual in which supplicants don garments packed with ice.
                    They then journey between six white pillars known as the
                    Kisses of Auril, which are dispersed throughout the city.
                    The worshipers move from pillar to pillar, chanting prayers
                    to the goddess. Upon reaching a pillar, a supplicant must
                    climb it and then "kiss the lady," touching lips to a rusty
                    iron plate at the top. In winter, these events resemble
                    frantic footraces, with the added risk of frostbite and
                    injuries caused by falling from the slippery pillars. The
                    parade runners are cheered on by patrons who come out of
                    nearby taverns to place bets on the stamina of the
                    participants. Those who finish the race are thought to have
                    helped make the winter easier, and they rarely have to pay
                    for food or ale all winter long.

                    Few pay homage to Azuth aside from wizards. For them, the
                    High One is the ultimate embodiment of all that they hold
                    dear.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mystra serves as goddess of magic; Oghma is god of
                    knowledge; and Deneir is god of writing and language. Azuth
                    takes aspects of these general fields and applies them to
                    the specific practices of wizards. For instance, while
                    Mystra is the deity who represents the soul, art, and wonder
                    of magic, Azuth is god of a wizard's long hours of study,
                    exacting standards of movement and speech, and cramped,
                    ink-stained fingers. Wizards invoke Azuth when they scribe
                    scrolls, inscribe magic circles, attempt to memorize spells,
                    and even when they cast spells. Often this acknowledgment
                    comes in the form of silently forming Azuth's holy symbol,
                    pointing the index finger of the left hand to the sky. For
                    many wizards, the gesture is so commonplace in their lives
                    that it becomes an unconscious habit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Temples dedicated to Azuth are scarce, and clerics of the
                    deity are extremely rare. Even in magic-saturated Halruaa,
                    only a handful of holy places are dedicated to Azuth.
                    Sometimes a statue or a shrine dedicated to him stands in a
                    corner of a temple to Mystra or another deity. More often, a
                    wizard has a personal shrine at home. Azuth is represented
                    at such sites as a hooded and bearded figure with left hand
                    held high, finger pointed up. Sometimes he is represented by
                    merely the hand. In either case, the finger often serves as
                    a candleholder or as the point of origin for a light spell.

                    Bane has a simple ethos: the strong have not just the right
                    but the duty to rule over the weak. A tyrant who is able to
                    seize power must do so, for not only does the tyrant
                    benefit, but so do those under the tyrant's rule. When a
                    ruler succumbs to decadence, corruption, or decrepitude, a
                    stronger and more suitable ruler will rise.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Bane is vilified in many legends. Throughout history, those
                    who favor him have committed dark deeds in his name, but
                    most people don't worship Bane out of malice. Bane
                    represents ambition and control, and those who have the
                    former but lack the latter pray to him to give them
                    strength. It is said that Bane favors those who exhibit
                    drive and courage, and that he aids those who seek to become
                    conquerors, carving kingdoms from the wilderness, and
                    bringing order to the lawless.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At many times and in many places in Faer&ucirc;n, the
                    faithful of Bane have been seen as saviors for their efforts
                    in slaughtering raiders, throwing down corrupt rulers, or
                    saving armies on the brink of defeat. But in just as many
                    other places, the worship of Bane has created or supported
                    cruel dictatorships, aided mercantile monopolies, or brought
                    about the practice of slavery where before it didn't exist.

                    Beshaba is the counterpoint to Tymora and is just as
                    frequently acknowledged in daily life as is her more
                    benevolent "sister." She is seen as a cruel and capricious
                    goddess who must be propitiated to avoid attracting her
                    attention and interest in a negative way
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Beshaba's name is invoked when someone is beset by bad
                    luck-which could be as minor as stubbing a toe or breaking a
                    wagon wheel, or as catastrophic as slipping and accidentally
                    falling off a cliff. It is also invoked to ward off her
                    attentions when someone is doing something in which good
                    luck wouldn't play a part but bad luck might. For example,
                    someone rolling dice would invoke Tymora because they want
                    random chance to fall in their favor, but someone about to
                    cross a rickety bridge would ask Beshaba to keep the bridge
                    intact.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Folk make the symbol of Beshaba by folding in their thumbs
                    and extending their fingers on one or both hands (mimicking
                    the horns of her holy symbol) to ward off misfortune. The
                    same gesture raised to the head signifies a salute; when
                    pointed at someone, the "horns" indicate ill favor directed
                    toward that individual.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Many druids worship Beshaba as one of the First Circle. They
                    propitiate her with dances while wearing fire-blackened
                    antlers dipped in blood. According to these druids, her holy
                    symbol is the horns of a stag because when Beshaba was first
                    worshiped, humans were simple hunter-gatherers and she was
                    believed to bring misfortune to hunters, such as being gored
                    by a stag.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although most people tremble in fear at the prospect of
                    Beshaba's attendance at any event (even in spirit), Beshaba
                    is almost always invoked and welcomed formally in the
                    opening speeches or ceremonies of formal functions such as
                    marriages and coronations, contests of sport or martial
                    prowess, and at the naming ceremonies of children. If she
                    isn't invited to such an event, she might take offense and
                    wreak misfortune on those involved.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Temples to Beshaba are virtually unknown. It's common,
                    however, for rural folk to erect a post and mount antlers on
                    it at the site of some roadside accident or murder. In
                    cities, where antlers are hard to come by and murders and
                    accidents more prevalent, the fashion is to draw the black
                    antlers of Beshaba with charcoal on a nearby wall, leaving
                    the symbol on display until weather scours it away. These
                    "shrines," in either form, serve as warnings to others about
                    places of ill fortune.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    More formal shrines to Beshaba exist in places where folk
                    frequently hope to ward off misfortune. These sites tend to
                    be posts or stones painted red with blackened antlers
                    attached to them, or a red, triangular wallmounted plaque
                    with attached antlers. Both types have a stone or bronze
                    bowl where coins can be tossed or burnt offerings made. The
                    Red Wizards of Thay commonly erect such shrines outside
                    their ritual chambers to guard against unfortunate mistakes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Few dare to take Beshaba as a patron. The rare clerics of
                    the Maid of Misfortune are those who have been deeply
                    affected by great misfortunes and who seek to warn others of
                    the essential unfairness of life- or to inflict that
                    unfairness upon them.

                    The folk of Faer&ucirc;n don't normally pray to or
                    acknowledge Bhaal. He is seen as a deeply evil and
                    destructive deity who hungers for death- meaning the death
                    of any sentient beings through unlawful means.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some people pray to Bhaal when they want to commit murder. A
                    person might have good reason to resort to murder, such as
                    when one is unable to redress some injustice through lawful
                    means. But it's far more common for prayers to Bhaal to be
                    uttered by those who seek to kill someone out of jealousy,
                    greed, or wrath. It's rare for anyone but assassins or
                    compulsive killers to take Bhaal as a patron, and clerics
                    who revere Bhaal often qualify on both counts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Murder cults of Bhaal have arisen in the past, each led by a
                    charismatic, self-styled priest of Bhaal, but organized
                    worship of the Lord of Murder is extremely uncommon. Temples
                    and shrines are similarly rare. Those who erect a shrine to
                    Bhaal usually do so to thank him for a successful murder.
                    Such shrines typically feature a skull or a severed head
                    surrounded by drops of blood (often both from the murdered
                    victim).

                  <p>
                    Chauntea is goddess of agriculture: sowing and reaping,
                    seeding and harvest, breeding and butchery, shearing and
                    weaving. In this aspect she is a rural deity rarely prayed
                    to behind the walls of a city except by kitchen gardeners.
                    But Chauntea is also the Great Mother, a goddess of crib,
                    hearth, and home. And as such she is welcomed into all homes
                    at mealtimes and at the birth of children, and folk give her
                    thanks whenever they experience the pleasure of settling by
                    a fire and feeling safe and loved.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Chauntea's faith is one of nurturing and growth.
                    Agricultural aphorisms and farming parables dot her
                    teachings. Growing and reaping, the eternal cycle, is a
                    common theme in the faith. Destruction for its own sake, or
                    leveling without rebuilding, is anathema to her.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Temples of Chauntea maintain a great body of lore about
                    farming and cultivation. Her priests work closely with
                    communities in rural areas, and they are willing to roll up
                    their sleeves and dig their hands into the dirt.

                  <p>
                    The worship of Cyric derives directly from the story of his
                    ascension to godhood. Cyric was a mortal during the Time of
                    Troubles and the key to how that chaotic period resolved,
                    but he was also a selfish traitor and a murderer. When he
                    became a god, Cyric continued to work various plots of
                    deceit and murder- the most famous of which is that,
                    according to legend, Cyric murdered Mystra and thus caused
                    the Spellplague over a century ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Those who don't worship Cyric see him as a god of madness,
                    strife, and deceit, although his priests consider such
                    claims to be heresy. Their Prince of Lies isn't a twisted
                    madman, but a god of dark majesty who proves that,
                    ultimately, all bonds between folk corrupt and wither away.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cyric's church works openly in Arnn, where the citizens
                    espouse the principles of ambition, self-reliance, and
                    "buyer beware." Those who take Cyric as their patron tend to
                    be sadists, con artists, power-mad connivers, and worse.
                    Other folk pray to Cyric when they want to do wrong but
                    don't want others to find out about it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The Dark Sun," originally one of Cyric's epithets, has
                    become a metaphor for strife in the Realms. "A Dark Sun has
                    risen o'er this court" might be spoken as a warning that
                    intrigues and infighting have gotten out of hand in a noble
                    household; and married couples know to seek advice .from
                    others if "a Dark Sun shines through the window" in their
                    relationship.

                    Deneir is the god of literature and literacy, the patron of
                    the artist and the scribe. His is the power to accurately
                    render and describe, to write and to read, and to pass on
                    information. In legend, Deneir is often portrayed as being a
                    scribe in service to Oghma, and he is sometimes thought of
                    as Oghma's right hand.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's common practice for someone who writes a letter or
                    records information to say a prayer to Deneir to avoid
                    mistakes. Similarly, artists acknowledge Deneir before
                    beginning and upon completing paintings, particularly
                    illuminations on manuscripts, tapestries that relate
                    stories, and any such attempt to use art to capture the
                    truth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Followers of Deneir believe that information not recorded
                    and saved for later use is information lost. They consider
                    literacy an important gift of the gods, one that should be
                    spread and taught. His followers are scribes and scholars
                    devoted, like their patron, to preserving written works, and
                    also to experiencing them, for they say that Deneir himself
                    is hidden within the lines, shapes, and passages of all
                    written works. Priests of Deneir take an oath of charity as
                    well, compelling them to accept the requests of others to
                    write letters and transcribe information.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The god's followers tend to be individualists, united by
                    their shared faith but not overly concerned with religious
                    hierarchy and protocol. This behavior is supported by the
                    fact that Deneir's blessings of divine magic are more often
                    bestowed on those who lose themselves in written works than
                    on those who fancy themselves part of any temple or
                    religious order. Contemplation of the faith's most holy
                    book, the Tome of Universal Harmony, is the most effective
                    way to become deserving of Deneir's blessings.

                    present at many such places, particularly those that serve
                    as druid groves. Eldath is a goddess of comfort, healing,
                    and calm. Her blessed waters heal the sick, cure madness,
                    and comfort the dying.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most rural places have a pond or a glade that locals ascribe
                    to Eldath. Tradition dictates that it be a place of quiet
                    reflection where others are left to their thoughts. A body
                    of water such as a pond or a spring typically serves as a
                    repository of offerings. If the holy site is a glade, a
                    stream one crosses along the way might serve as the
                    repository, or a prominent bush or tree in the glade might
                    be the place where people tie offerings. Typical offerings
                    are broken weapons or items that are remembrances of
                    arguments, which the faithful discard while making a wish
                    for peace in the future. Many of those who favor Eldath are
                    pacifists or people who are troubled by violence they have
                    witnessed or experienced.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Eldath's priests don't organize into large sects. Indeed,
                    many are itinerant, wandering between various holy sites and
                    shrines, seeing that the locations are cared for and that
                    they remain places of sweet serenity. The faithful of Eldath
                    are usually close to nature, and allied to druids, who count
                    Eldath among the First Circle. It is taboo to strike a
                    priest of Eldath, and killing one is said to bring great
                    misfortune. Despite the measure of protection that this
                    belief affords them, most priests of Eldath avoid conflicts
                    rather than attempting to quell them. Those who serve Eldath
                    are happy to preside over peaceful negotiations and to
                    certify treaties, but they can't force others to engage in
                    harmony.

                    Gond is the god of artifice, craft, and construction. He is
                    revered by blacksmiths, woodworkers, engineers, and
                    inventors. Anyone who is crafting something might say a
                    prayer to Gond to guide the work, but folk know that Gond
                    smiles most brightly upon new inventions that others find
                    useful.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Priests of Gond wander the North dressed in saffron
                    vestments, adorned with sashes that contain within their
                    folds gears, locks, hooks, and bits of steel, tin, and wood
                    that might prove useful in a pinch. They also wear belts of
                    large, linked metal medallions and enormous sun hats. A
                    traveling priest of Gond offers services to distant villages
                    as a tinker, a carpenter, and a civil engineer rolled into
                    one, ready to help build a better paddock gate, dig a new
                    well, or mend pots or furniture that might otherwise go to
                    waste. All priests of Gond keep journals in which they
                    record ideas, inventions, and innovations discovered in
                    their travels, and take great delight in meeting fellow
                    priests and sharing their finds. In large cities, the Gondar
                    construct temples that serve as great workshops and
                    inventors' labs. Wandering priests turn their journals over
                    to the resident scribes at such temples, who then record the
                    priests' observations for posterity and the benefit of all
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most who favor Gond practice time-honored crafting
                    professions: they are smiths and engineers, architects and
                    weavers, leatherworkers and jewelers. Even so, this faith
                    has a well-earned reputation as a haven for crackpot
                    inventors and visionaries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The center of Gond's worship on the Sword Coast lies in
                    Baldur's Gate, where the faithful have erected two huge
                    structures in honor of the Wonderbringer: a temple called
                    the High House of Wonders and a museum of craft and design
                    called the Hall of Wonders. Lantan had been the preeminent
                    place of Gond's worship in the world until a century ago,
                    when the island nation disappeared, and since its return the
                    few Lantanese merchants seen in Sword Coast ports have said
                    little about the present state of their homeland.

                    Few aside from rangers of the North pray to Gwaeron
                    Windstrom. Said to have been a mortal man elevated to
                    godhood by Mielikki, Gwaeron serves rangers as their
                    intercessor with Mielikki. He is seen as a master ranger,
                    the perfect tracker, a peerless animal handler, and a
                    dedicated foe of rapacious creatures such as trolls and
                    ores. He is said to look like an old man with a long white
                    beard who is still hale and mighty, and he is believed to
                    take rest and sleep in a stand of trees near Triboar.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Rangers pray to Gwaeron because he represents much of the
                    work they do, and because he can speak to Mielikki on their
                    behalf. In the North, most rangers view Mielikki as too
                    mysterious, holy, and wild to be addressed directly with
                    their requests, but they consider Gwaeron Windstrom to be
                    one of them and thus understanding of their needs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Gwaeron has no temples, but shrines dedicated to him can be
                    found in many places that serve wilderness wanderers as
                    trail markers. Each one is denoted by a carving of Gwaeron's
                    symbol, a paw print with a star on the palm, on a prominent
                    tree or stone.

                    The god of vigilance and protection, Helm is seen as the
                    epitome of the guardian, the watcher, and the guard. He is
                    venerated by those who need to remain watchful for enemies
                    or danger. Helm is a favorite deity of people who make a
                    living by protecting someone or something, such as
                    bodyguards, members of the city watch, and the guards of a
                    treasury vault.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Helm embodies the spirit of watchfulness without regard to
                    good or evil. In legends, he is honorable and keeps his word
                    to a fault, such as when he guarded the celestial stairways
                    during the Time of Troubles, preventing the gods from
                    ascending them and continuing the chaos of that period,
                    until the Tablets of Fate were found.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although his faith has known dark days, worship of Helm
                    never truly faded away. Most of his followers believe that
                    the Watcher can never be vanquished utterly, and recent
                    events have borne out that assertion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Helm's priests teach that one must be ever vigilant, ever
                    aware, ever prepared for one's enemies. Patience, clear
                    thought, and careful planning will always defeat rushed
                    actions in the end. Those who favor Helm strive to be alert,
                    clear-headed, and true to their word. These traits don't
                    necessarily make them nice people, however, and as such many
                    consider the faithful of Helm to be inflexible and
                    merciless.

                    Hoar, known in the lands along the Inner Sea as Assuran, is
                    a god of revenge and retribution. He isn't typically
                    worshiped habitually, but his name is invoked by those who
                    seek vengeance. When a guilty party falls prey to fate- such
                    as when a murderer escapes prosecution, but is then
                    accidentally slain himself- the hand of Hoar is given
                    credit. When one hears three rolls of thunder in succession,
                    it is thought to be a sign from Hoar that some act of
                    vengeance has been performed. Many human societies have the
                    custom of ringing a bell or a gong three times when judgment
                    of a crime is rendered or an execution takes place.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Folk speak Hoar's name when they want revenge, particularly
                    when they are incapable of avenging themselves. This
                    invocation might be in response to a petty slight or a true
                    injustice, and the acknowledgment of Hoar might be a short
                    prayer said aloud or might be written down somewhere. It's
                    generally believed that the more permanent the form of the
                    prayer, the more likely it is to be fulfilled. For this
                    reason, some etch their prayers in lead and bury it or hide
                    their prayers inside diaries. Aside from bounty hunters and
                    those on crusades of vengeance, few truly revere Hoar, and
                    he is served by fewer still who would call themselves
                    priests. Temples or shrines of Hoar are almost nonexistent
                    except for ancient sites in Chessenta and Unther.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hoar became a member of the Faerfinian pantheon when his
                    worship extended beyond the lands that originally revered
                    him. Most consider Tyr to be the arbiter of laws, and Hoar
                    to be the god who metes out punishment that comes as a
                    result of breaking those codes. A judge might favor the
                    worship of Tyr, while a jail or or a headsman is more likely
                    to pray to Hoar.

                  <div class="light-horizontal-line"></div>
                  <p>
                    Ilmater is the god of suffering, martyrdom, and
                    perseverance, renowned for his compassion and endurance. It
                    is he who offers succor and calming words to those who are
                    in pain, victimized, or in great need. He is the willing
                    sufferer, the one who takes the place of another to heft the
                    other's burden, to take the other's pain. He is the god of
                    the oppressed and the unjustly treated.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is said that if he had his way, the Crying God would take
                    all the suffering in the world onto himself, so as to spare
                    others. Since he can't, he blesses those who endure on
                    others' behalf, and he alleviates suffering when he can.
                    Martyrs who die that others may live are always blessed by
                    II mater with a final rest and reward in the god's
                    afterlife, should they so choose.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ilmater's priests take in the ill, the starving, and the
                    injured, and his temples give most of what they receive to
                    help offset the suffering of the world. His followers
                    provide succor when they can, but also use force to put an
                    end to torture and suffering inflicted on others. Ilmater's
                    priests travel to places where the worst possible conditions
                    exist, ministering to the needs of the oppressed, the
                    deceased, and the poor. They put others ahead of themselves,
                    are sharing of all they have, and emphasize the spiritual
                    nature of life over the welfare of the material body.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Priests of Ilmater who are on a quest to aid others can be
                    recognized by their hair shirts, vests of coarse fur worn
                    against the bare skin. It is taboo to harm such priests as
                    they go about their duties, such as when they administer to
                    the wounded on a battlefield. The taboo is so strongly felt
                    among humans that other races respect the custom. Even ores
                    and goblinoids will avoid directly attacking a peaceful
                    priest of Ilmater, as long as the priest administers to
                    their fallen warriors as well.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most folk deeply respect the work and the sacrifice of
                    Ilmater's faith, and lend aid to such endeavors where they
                    can. When a temple of Ilmater sends its faithful to help
                    refugees of war or victims of plague, their willingness to
                    sacrifice their own well-being always prompts ordinary
                    people to support them, whether they are inspired or shamed
                    into action.
