    <p>The warmth of a roaring hearth fire, the breathless joy of the hunt, the trackless paths of a long journey. Provided they are close to the ones they call family and pack, dogs can call anywhere home.

Loyalty, faith, devotion and selflessness have guided the dog through the ages.</p>

      <h4>Traits</h4>
      <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
      <p>The diversity of dogs is hard to generalize but dogs begin with the follow traits:</p>

Some possibilities include having the full ability of speech, being uncannily effective at conveying meaning through gesture and sounds ("I think she is saying the kids are down in the well") or having another character who can understand and interpret for the dog.
