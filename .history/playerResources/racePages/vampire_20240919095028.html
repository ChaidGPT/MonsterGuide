        <p>Vampires are pale, humanoid beings who are neither dead nor alive. They are Undead, feeding from the life
            force of living things. They have dark, even reddish eyes and long, sharp fangs that can be retracted at
            will. They are known for their strength, speed, and charm, which can be a very deadly combination. Apart
            from their gained undead appearance, they look very similar to whatever they looked like in life.</p>

            <h4>Traits</h4>
            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <p>Vampirism is a curse, however some of the traits that are gained may make one rethink if its really that
                terrible.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Charisma, Dexterity and Strength scores all
                increase by 2.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Age:</span> Vampires are Immortal, and do not age a day from when they were
                turned.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Alignment:</span> Becoming a Vampire is either by choice, or accident. A pious
                man seeking immortality, or an Elf desiring power to rule are some scenarios that can turn one into a
                Vampire. Or even a Half-Orc being in the wrong place at the wrong time could turn into a night of new
                found immortality. No matter how one came to be a Vampire, after some time of dwelling in darkness, evil
                might be the easiest thing to cling to. However, with strong enough will, one could maintain their
                values and remain the alignment they had in life.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Size:</span> There is no change in your size once becoming a Vampire.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text tip" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="The distance in feet that the character or monster can move in 1 round">Speed:</span> Your base walking speed is 45</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text tip" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="The ability of a character to understand, speak, and read different languages, facilitating communication and interaction with various cultures and creatures in the game world">Languages:</span> You know the languages known in life.</p>

            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>

            <p><span class="bold-text">Superior Darkvision:</span> You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if
                it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can discern color in darkness.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Undead:</span> You are an Undead creature. Necrotic damage does not affect you.
                You also need 1 ration of blood every 5 days or your body begins to cease functioning. On the 5th day
                without blood, the Vampire is unable to heal and takes 1d20 of damage every hour and rolls disadvantage
                on everything. If the Vampire drops to 0 hit points from this, they are paralyzed until force fed blood.
                Then they regain 1d20 hit points taken from loss of blood and no longer roll disadvantage.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Compulsion:</span> The Vampire can control the mind of another simply through eye
                contact. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled by the Vampire.
                Compelled beings usually follow the instructions given to them to the best of their ability, and are
                willing subjects to the Vampire's bite attack. Some species of naturally occurring herbs can prevent
                compulsion.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Sunlight Hypersensitivity:</span> Because of the corpse a vampire resides in,
                sunlight burns any skin it comes into contact with. A Vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its
                turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Forbiddance:</span> Luckily for every living creature, a Vampire can not enter a
                residence without an invitation from the owner.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Stake to the Heart:</span> If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the
                Vampires heart, the Vampire begins to desiccate and is paralyzed until the stake is removed. However, if
                this happens when a Vampire is at 0 hit points, they spontaneously combust and are destroyed. The soul
                of the Vampire leaves the burning corpse and seeks its final resting place. It may be captured and used
                as a component to a spell.</p>

            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>

            <h4>Vampiric Feats</h4>
            <p>Vampires learn these as they become better acquainted with their new Immortal form. </p>

            <p><span class="bold-text">Bite:</span> At 1st level, you can use your sharp fangs to inflict damage. One
                willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the Vampire, incapacitated, or restrained. Hit:
                2d6+DEX <span class="tip" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Piercing damage represents the physical harm caused by a sharp object piercing through a target's defenses" style="text-decoration: underline;">piercing damage</span> plus 2d8 necrotic damage. The amount of bite damage increases as you gain
                levels. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and
                the Vampire regains hit points equal to that. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest.
                You may use your bonus action to drink their blood dealing 1d12 damage. This also satisfies your need
                for blood. A humanoid slain after being bitten, and then buried in the ground will rise the following
                night as a Vampire Spawn.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Healing Blood:</span> Starting at 5th level, your immortal nature is imbedded in
                your blood, making your Vampire blood able to heal any living creature by 1d20+CON.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Blood Manipulation:</span> When you reach 7th level, your knowledge of organic
                processes and experience with your victims life blood grants you the dark magic ability to siphon out
                your targets blood (if they have an open wound) and mold it into any solid construct. This action deals
                1d12 damage. The construct becomes liquid if the target dies.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Creatures of the Night:</span> Beginning at 9th level, your relation to dark
                creatures gives you power over weaker creatures of the night. As an action you can call 2d4 swarms of
                Bats or Rats at night time, or 3d6 wolves if outside. The creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds and obey your
                spoken commands.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Legendary Resistance (3/day):</span> When you reach 12th level, because you are
                king of the night, if a you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead.</p>S <p><span
                    class="bold-text">Flight:</span> At 19th level, you gain the ability to Fly. No creature is safe
                anymore. Your Flying speed is 60 feet.</p>

                    then rises the next night. The result of this process is a Vampire Spawn, which is not a true
                    Vampire. Vampire Spawn are pawns of the Vampire that turned it, and are completely under the control
                    of their sire. But, if a Vampire Spawn drinks the blood of a True Vampire, it will then become a

                    they use to spend their sleeping hours beneath the ground. Their resting places are usually
