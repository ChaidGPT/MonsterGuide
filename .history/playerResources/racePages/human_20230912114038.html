        <p>In the reckonings of most worlds, humans are the youngest of the common races, late to arrive on the world
            scene and short-lived in comparison to dwarves, elves, and dragons. Perhaps it is because of their shorter
            lives that they strive to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given. Or maybe they feel they
            have something to prove to the elder races, and that’s why they build their mighty empires on the foundation
            of conquest and trade. Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of
            the worlds.</p>

            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <p>It’s hard to make generalizations about humans, but your human character has these traits.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your ability scores each increase by 1.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Age:</span> Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a
                century.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Alignment:</span> Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and the
                worst are found among them.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Size:</span> Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well
                over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Speed:</span> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Languages:</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of
                your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure
                dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc curses,
                Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.</p>

                <h5>A Broad Spectrums</h5>
                <p>With their penchant for migration and conquest, humans are more physically diverse than other common
                    races. There is no typical human. An individual can stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall
                    and weigh from 125 to 250 pounds. Human skin shades range from nearly black to very pale, and hair
                    colors from black to blond (curly, kinky, or straight); males might sport facial hair that is sparse
                    or thick. A lot of humans have a dash of nonhuman blood, revealing hints of elf, orc, or other
                    lineages. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and rarely live even a single century.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <div id="varietyInAllThings">
                <h5>Variety in All Things</h5>
                <p>Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races. They have widely varying
                    tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands where they have settled. When they settle,
                    though, they stay: they build cities to last for the ages, and great kingdoms that can persist for
                    long centuries. An individual human might have a relatively short life span, but a human nation or
                    culture preserves traditions with origins far beyond the reach of any single human’s memory. They
                    live fully in the present—making them well suited to the adventuring life—but also plan for the
                    future, striving to leave a lasting legacy. Individually and as a group, humans are adaptable
                    opportunists, and they stay alert to changing political and social dynamics.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <div id="lastingInstitutions">
                <h5>Lasting Institutions</h5>
                <p>Where a single elf or dwarf might take on the responsibility of guarding a special location or a
                    powerful secret, humans found sacred orders and institutions for such purposes. While dwarf clans
                    and halfling elders pass on the ancient traditions to each new generation, human temples,
                    governments, libraries, and codes of law fix their traditions in the bedrock of history. Humans
                    dream of immortality, but (except for those few who seek undeath or divine ascension to escape
                    death’s clutches) they achieve it by ensuring that they will be remembered when they are gone.</p>
                <p>Although some humans can be xenophobic, in general their societies are inclusive. Human lands welcome
                    large numbers of nonhumans compared to the proportion of humans who live in nonhuman lands.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <div id="exemplarsOfAmbition">
                <h5>Exemplars of Ambition</h5>
                <p>Humans who seek adventure are the most daring and ambitious members of a daring and ambitious
                    race.They seek to earn glory in the eyes of their fellows by amassing power, wealth, and fame. More
                    than other people, humans champion causes rather than territories or groups.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <div id="humanNamesAndEthnicities">
                <h5>Human Names and Ethnicities</h5>
                <p>Having so much more variety than other cultures, humans as a whole have no typical names. Some human
                    parents give their children names from other languages, such as Dwarvish or Elvish (pronounced more
                    or less correctly), but most parents give names that are linked to their region’s culture or to the
                    naming traditions of their ancestors.</p>
                <p>The material culture and physical characteristics of humans can change wildly from region to
                    region.In the Forgotten Realms, for example, the clothing, architecture, cuisine, music, and
                    literature are different in the northwestern lands of the Silver Marches than in distant Turmish or
                    Impiltur to the east—and even more distinctive in far-off Kara-Tur. Human physical characteristics,
                    though, vary according to the ancient migrations of the earliest humans, so that the humans of the
                    Silver Marches have every possible variation of coloration and features.</p>
                <p>In the Forgotten Realms, nine human ethnic groups are widely recognized, though over a dozen others
                    are found in more localized areas of Faerun. These groups, and the typical names of their members,
                    can be used as inspiration no matter which world your human is in.</p>
                <h5>Calishite</h5>
                <p>Shorter and slighter in build than m ost other humans, Calishites have dusky brown skin, hair, and

                    and amber-skinned, with eyes of hazel or brown. Their hair ranges from black to dark brown, but in
                    the lands where the Mulan are most prominent, nobles and many other Mulan shave off all their hair.
