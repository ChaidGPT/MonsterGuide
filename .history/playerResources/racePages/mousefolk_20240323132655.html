                <h5>Virtuous and Headstrong</h5>
                <p>Despite their generally flighty appearance, mousefolk are a very honorable people. They believe strongly in personal honor, less so in the idea that the actions of others can impugn that honor. When a mousefolk makes a mistake, especially one that causes harm to others, they will work hard and at long lengths to correct that mistake.</p>

                <h5>Kind and Curious</h5>
                <p>Halflings are an affable and cheerful people. They cherish the bonds of family and friendship as well
                    as the comforts of hearth and home, harboring few dreams of gold or glory. Even adventurers among
                    them usually venture into the world for reasons of community, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity.
                    They love discovering new things, even simple things, such as an exotic food or an unfamiliar style
                    of clothing.</p>
                <p>Halflings are easily moved to pity and hate to see any living thing suffer. They are generous,
                    happily sharing what they have even in lean times.</p>

                <p>Halflings are adept at fitting into a community of humans, dwarves, or elves, making themselves
                    valuable and welcome. The combination of their inherent stealth and their unassuming.</p>
                <p>Halflings work readily with others, and they are loyal to their friends, whether halfling or
                    otherwise. They can display remarkable ferocity when their friends, families, or communities are
                    threatened.</p>

            <div id="pastoralPleasantries">
                <h5>Pastoral Pleasantries</h5>
                <p>Most halflings live in small, peaceful communities with large farms and well-kept groves. They rarely
                    build kingdoms of their own or even hold much land beyond their quiet shires. They typically don’t
                    recognize any sort of halfling nobility or royalty, instead looking to family elders to guide them.
                    Families preserve their traditional ways despite the rise and fall of empires.</p>
                <p>Many halflings live among other races, where the halflings’ hard work and loyal outlook offer them
                    abundant rewards and creature comforts. Some halfling communities travel as a way of life, driving
                    wagons or guiding boats from place to place and maintaining no permanent home.</p>

                <h5>Exploring Opportunities</h5>
                <p>Halflings usually set out on the adventurer’s path to defend their communities, support their
                    friends, or explore a wide and wonder-filled world. For them, adventuring is less a career than an
                    opportunity or sometimes a necessity.</p>

                <p>A halfling has a given name, a family name, and possibly a nickname. Family names are often nicknames
