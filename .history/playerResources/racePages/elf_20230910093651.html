        <p>Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.</p>

            <h4>Traits</h4>
            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <p>Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of elven refinement.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Dexterity score increases by 2.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Age:</span> Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claim s adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Alignment:</span> Elves love freedom , variety, and sel-fexpression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. The drow are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Size:</span> Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Speed:</span> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Darkvision:</span> Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Keen Senses:</span> You have proficiency in the Perception skill.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Fey Ancestry:</span> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Trance:</span> Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Languages:</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Subrace:</span> Ancient divides among the elven people resulted in three main subraces: high elves, wood elves, and dark elves, who are commonly called drow. Choose one of these subraces. In some worlds, these subraces are divided still further (such as the sun elves and moon elves of the Forgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can choose a narrower subrace.</p>

            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <h6>High Elf</h6>
            <p>As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds of D&D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type (which includes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk. the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.</p>
            <p>The sun elves of Faerun (also called gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with gold.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Intelligence score increases by 2.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Elf Weapon Training:</span> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Cantrip:</span> You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Extra Language:</span> You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.</p>

            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <h6>Wood Elf</h6>
            <p>As a wood elf, you have keen senses and intuition, and your fleet feet carry you quickly and stealthily through your native forests. This category includes the wild elves (grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of Dragonlance, as well as the races called wood elves in Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms. In Faerun, wood elves (also called wild elves, green elves, or forest elves) are reclusive and distrusting of non-elves.</p>
            <p>Wood elves’ skin tends to be copperish in hue, sometimes with traces of green. Their hair tends toward browns and blacks, but it is occasionally blond or copper-colored. Their eyes are green, brown, or hazel.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Elf Weapon Training:</span> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Fleet of Foot:</span> Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Mask of the Wild:</span> You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.</p>

            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <h6>Dark Elf (Drow)</h6>
            <p>Descended from an earlier subrace of dark-skinned elves, the drow were banished from the surface world for following the goddess Lolth down the path to evil and corruption. Now they have built their own civilization in the depths of the Underdark, patterned after the Way of Lolth. Also called dark elves, the drow have black skin that resembles polished obsidian and stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly have very pale eyes (so pale as to be mistaken for white) in shades of lilac, silver, pink, red, and blue. They tend to be smaller and thinner than most elves.</p>
            <p>Drow adventurers are rare, and the race does not exist in all worlds. Check with your Dungeon Master to see if you can play a drow character.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Charisma score increases by 1.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Superior Darkvision:</span> Your darkvision has a radius of 120 feet.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Sunlight Sensitivity:</span> You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Drow Magic:</span>  You know the dancing lights cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the faerie fire spell once per day. When you reach 5th level, you can also cast the darkness spell once per day. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Drow Weapon Training:</span> You have proficiency with rapiers, shortswords, and hand crossbows.</p>

            <div id="shortAndStout">
                <h5>Short and Stout</h5>
                <p>Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though
                    they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a
                    human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any
                    of the larger folk.</p>
                <p>Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are
                    light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is
                    usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their
                    beards highly and groom them carefully.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <div id="longMemoryLongGrudges">
                <h5>Long Memory, Long Grudges</h5>
                <p>Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often rem em ber a very
                    different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of
                    the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the
                    fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a
                    perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.</p>
                <p>Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with
                    stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their
                    ancestry back to the founding o f their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and
                    don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the
                    dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the
                    forge.</p>
                <p>Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to
                    the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense o f justice, and they are slow to forget
                    wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf’s entire clan, so
                    what begins as one dwarf’s hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <div id="clansAndKingdoms">
                <h5>Clans and Kingdoms</h5>
                <p>Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals
                    and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry,
                    and in some dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can’t find in their
                    mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings
                    frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are
                    welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them.</p>
                <p>The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves
                    who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan identities and affiliations, recognize
                    related dwarves, and invoke their ancestors’ names in oaths and curses. To be clanless is the worst
                    fate that can befall a dwarf.</p>
                <p>Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially weapon smiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some
                    become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after for their courage and loyalty.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <div id="godsGoldAndClan">
                <h5>Gods, Gold, and Clan</h5>
                <p>Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a desire for treasure—for its own
                    sake, for a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help others. Other dwarves are
                    driven by the com m and or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to bring
                    glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek
                    to restore a clan’s lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place
                    within the clan after having been exiled. Or a dwarf might search for the axe wielded by a mighty
                    ancestor, lost on the field of battle centuries ago.</p>

                <h5>Dwarf Names</h5>
                <p>A dwarf’s name is granted by a clan elder, in accordance with tradition. Every proper dwarven name
                    has been used and reused down through the generations. A dwarf’s name belongs to the clan, not to
                    the individual.A dwarf who misuses or brings shame to a clan name is stripped of the name and
                    forbidden by law to use any dwarven name in its place.</p>
