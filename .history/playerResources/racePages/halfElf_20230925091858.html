        <p>Walking in two worlds but truly belonging to neither, half-elves combine what some say are the best qualities
            of their elf and human parents: human curiosity, inventiveness, and ambition tempered by the refined senses,
            love of nature, and artistic tastes of the elves. Some half-elves live among humans, set apart by their
            emotional and physical differences, watching friends and loved ones age while time barely touches them.
            Others live with the elves, growing restless as they reach adulthood in the timeless elven realms, while
            their peers continue to live as children. Many half-elves, unable to fit into either society, choose lives
            of solitary wandering or join with other misfits and outcasts in the adventuring life.</p>

            <p>Your half-elf character has some qualities in common with elves and some that are unique to half-elves.
            </p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Charisma score increases by 2, and two other
                ability scores of your choice increase by 1.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Age:</span> Half-elves mature at the same rate humans do and reach adulthood
                around the age of 20. They live much longer than humans, however, often exceeding 180 years.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Alignment:</span> Half-elves share the chaotic bent of their elven heritage. They
                value both personal freedom and creative expression, demonstrating neither love of leaders nor desire
                for followers. They chafe at rules, resent others’ demands, and sometimes prove unreliable, or at least
                unpredictable.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Size:</span> Half-elves are about the same size as humans, ranging from 5 to 6
                feet tall. Your size is Medium.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Speed:</span> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Darkvision:</span> Thanks to your elf blood, you have superior vision in dark and
                dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in
                darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Fey Ancestry:</span> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed,
                and magic can’t put you to sleep.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Skill Versatility:</span> You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Languages:</span> You can speak, read, and write Common, Elvish, and one extra
                language of your choice.</p>

                <h5>Of Two Worlds</h5>
                <p>To humans, half-elves look like elves, and to elves, they look human. In height, they’re on par with
                    both parents, though they’re neither as slender as elves nor as broad as humans. They range from
                    under 5 feet to about 6 feet tall, and from 100 to 180 pounds, with men only slightly taller and
                    heavier than women. Half-elf men do have facial hair, and sometimes grow beards to mask their elven
                    ancestry. Half-elven coloration and features lie somewhere between their human and elf parents, and
                    thus show a variety even more pronounced than that found among either race. They tend to have the
                    eyes of their elven parents.</p>
            </div>

                <h5>Diplomats or Wanderers</h5>
                <p>Half-elves have no lands o f their own, though they are welcome in human cities and somewhat less
                    welcome in elven forests. In large cities in regions where elves and humans interact often,
                    half-elves are sometimes numerous enough to form small communities of their own. They enjoy the
                    company of other half-elves, the only people who truly understand what it is to live between these
                    two worlds.</p>
                <p>In most parts of the world, though, half-elves are uncommon enough that one might live for years
                    without meeting another. Some half-elves prefer to avoid company altogether, wandering the wilds as
                    trappers, foresters, hunters, or adventurers and visiting civilization only rarely. Like elves, they
                    are driven by the wanderlust that comes of their longevity. Others, in contrast, throw themselves
                    into the thick of society, putting their charisma and social skills to great use in diplomatic roles
                    or as swindlers.</p>

                <h5>Half-Elf Names</h5>
                <p>Half-elves use either human or elven naming conventions. As if to emphasize that they don’t really
                    fit in to either society, half-elves raised among humans are often given elven names, and those
                    raised among elves often take human names.</p>
