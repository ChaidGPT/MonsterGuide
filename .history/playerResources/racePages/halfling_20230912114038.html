        <p>The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings’ lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from
            marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing fire and a generous meal; fine drink and fine
            conversation. Though some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural communities, others form
            nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of
            new lands and peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, and home, though home might be a
            wagon jostling along an dirt road or a raft floating downriver.</p>

            <h4>Traits</h4>
            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <p>Your halfling character has a number of traits in common with all other halflings.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Dexterity score increases by 2.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Age:</span> A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives
                into the middle of his or her second century.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Alignment:</span> Most halflings are lawful good. As a rule, they are
                good-hearted and kind, hate to see others in pain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are also
                very orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on the support of their community and the comfort of their
                old ways.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Size:</span> Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your
                size is Small.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Speed:</span> Your base walking speed is 25 feet.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Lucky:</span> When you roll a 1 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving
                throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Brave:</span> You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Halfling Nimbleness:</span> You can move through the space of any creature that
                is of a size larger than yours.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Languages:</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The
                Halfling language isn’t secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others. They write very little,
                so they don’t have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all
                halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands hey dwell or through which they are
                traveling.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Subrace:</span> The two main kinds of halfling, lightfoot and stout, are more
                like closely related families than true subraces. Choose one of these subraces.</p>

            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <h6>Lightfoot</h6>
            <p>As a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from notice, even using other people as cover. You’re
                inclined to be affable and get along well with others. In the Forgotten Realms, lightfoot halflings have
                spread the farthest and thus are the most com m on variety.</p>
            <p>Lightfoots are m ore prone to wanderlust than other halflings, and often dwell alongside other races or
                take up a nomadic life. In the world of Greyhawk, these halflings are called hairfeet or tallfellows.
            </p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Charisma score increases by 1.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Naturally Stealthy:</span> You can attempt to hide even when you are obscured
                only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.</p>

            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <h6>Stout</h6>
            <p>As a stout halfling, you’re hardier than average and have some resistance to poison. Some say that stouts
                have dwarven blood. In the Forgotten Realms, these halflings are called stronghearts, and they’re most
                common in the south.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Constitution score increases by 1.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Stout Resilience:</span> You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and
                you have resistance against poison damage.</p>

            <div id="smallAndPractical">
                <h5>Small and Practical</h5>
                <p>The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger creatures by avoiding notice or, barring
                    that, avoiding offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively harmless and so have
                    managed to survive for centuries in the shadow of empires and on the edges of wars and political
                    strife. They are inclined to be stout, weighing between 40 and 45 pounds.</p>
                <p>Halflings’ skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy cast, and their hair is usually brown or sandy
                    brown and wavy. They have brown or hazel eyes. Halfling men often sport long sideburns, but beards
                    are rare among them and mustaches even more so. They like to wear simple, comfortable, and practical
                    clothes, favoring bright colors.</p>
                <p>Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing. They’re concerned with basic needs and simple
                    pleasures and have little use for ostentation. Even the wealthiest of halflings keep their treasures
                    locked in a cellar rather than on display for all to see. They have a knack for finding the most
                    straightforward solution to a problem, and have little patience for dithering.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <div id="kindAndCurious">
                <h5>Kind and Curious</h5>
                <p>Halflings are an affable and cheerful people. They cherish the bonds of family and friendship as well
                    as the comforts of hearth and home, harboring few dreams of gold or glory. Even adventurers among
                    them usually venture into the world for reasons of community, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity.
                    They love discovering new things, even simple things, such as an exotic food or an unfamiliar style
                    of clothing.</p>
                <p>Halflings are easily moved to pity and hate to see any living thing suffer. They are generous,
                    happily sharing what they have even in lean times.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <div id="blendIntoTheCrowd">
                <h5>Blend into the Crowd</h5>
                <p>Halflings are adept at fitting into a community of humans, dwarves, or elves, making themselves
                    valuable and welcome. The combination of their inherent stealth and their unassuming.</p>
                <p>Halflings work readily with others, and they are loyal to their friends, whether halfling or
                    otherwise. They can display remarkable ferocity when their friends, families, or communities are
                    threatened.</p>

            <div id="pastoralPleasantries">
                <h5>Pastoral Pleasantries</h5>
                <p>Most halflings live in small, peaceful communities with large farms and well-kept groves. They rarely
                    build kingdoms of their own or even hold much land beyond their quiet shires. They typically don’t
                    recognize any sort of halfling nobility or royalty, instead looking to family elders to guide them.
                    Families preserve their traditional ways despite the rise and fall of empires.</p>
                <p>Many halflings live among other races, where the halflings’ hard work and loyal outlook offer them
                    abundant rewards and creature comforts. Some halfling communities travel as a way of life, driving
                    wagons or guiding boats from place to place and maintaining no permanent home.</p>

                <h5>Exploring Opportunities</h5>
                <p>Halflings usually set out on the adventurer’s path to defend their communities, support their
                    friends, or explore a wide and wonder-filled world. For them, adventuring is less a career than an
                    opportunity or sometimes a necessity.</p>

                <p>A halfling has a given name, a family name, and possibly a nickname. Family names are often nicknames
                    that stuck so tenaciously they have been passed down through the generations.</p>
