        <p>Whether united under the leadership of a mighty warlock or having fought to a standstill after years of
            conflict, orc and human tribes sometimes form alliances, joining forces into a larger horde to the terror of
            civilized lands nearby. When these alliances are sealed by marriages, half-orcs are born. Some half-orcs
            rise to become proud chiefs of orc tribes, their human blood giving them an edge over their full-blooded orc
            rivals. Some venture into the world to prove their worth among humans and other more civilized races. Many
            of these become adventurers, achieving greatness for their mighty deeds and notoriety for their barbaric
            customs and savage fury.</p>

            <h4>Traits</h4>
            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <p>Your half-orc character has certain traits deriving from your ore ancestry.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Strength score increases by 2, and your
                Constitution score increases by 1.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Age:</span> Half-orcs mature a little faster than humans, reaching adulthood
                around age 14. They age noticeably faster and rarely live longer than 75 years.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Alignment:</span> Half-orcs inherit a tendency toward chaos from their orc
                parents and are not strongly inclined toward good. Half-orcs raised among ores and willing to live out
                their lives among them are usually evil.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Size:</span> Half-orcs are somewhat larger and bulkier than humans, and they
                range from 5 to well over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Speed:</span> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Darkvision:</span> Thanks to your orc blood, you have superior vision in dark and
                dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in
                darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Menacing:</span> You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Relentless Endurance:</span> When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed
                outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can’t use this feature again until you finish along
                rest.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Savage Attacks:</span> When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack,
                you can roll one of the weapon’s damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the
                critical hit.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Languages:</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and Orc. Orc is a harsh,
                grating language with hard consonants. It has no script of its own but is written in the Dwarvish
                script.</p>

                <h5>Scarred and Strong</h5>
                <p>Half-orcs’ grayish pigmentation, sloping foreheads, jutting jaws, prominent teeth, and towering
                    builds make their orcish heritage plain for all to see. Half-orcs stand between 6 and 7 feet tall
                    and usually weigh between 180 and 250 pounds.</p>
                <p>Orcs regard battle scars as tokens of pride and ornamental scars as things of beauty. Other scars,
                    though, mark an orc or half-orc as a former slave or a disgraced exile. Any half-orc who has lived
                    among or near orcs has scars, whether they are marks of humiliation or of pride, recounting their
                    past exploits and injuries. Such a half-orc living among humans might display these scars proudly or
                    hide them in shame.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <div id="theMarkOfGruumsh">
                <h5>The Mark of Gruumsh</h5>
                <p>The one-eyed god Gruumsh created the orcs, and even those orcs who turn away from his worship can’t
                    fully escape his influence. The same is true of half-orcs, though their human blood moderates the
                    impact of their orcish heritage. Some half-orcs hear the whispers of Gruumsh in their dreams,
                    calling them to unleash the rage that simmers within them. Others feel Gruumsh’s exultation when
                    they join in melee combat—and either exult along with him or shiver with fear and loathing.
                    Half-orcs are not evil by nature, but evil does lurk within them, whether they embrace it or rebel
                    against it.</p>
                <p>Beyond the rage of Gruumsh, half-orcs feel emotion powerfully. Rage doesn’t just quicken their pulse,
                    it makes their bodies burn. An insult stings like acid, and sadness saps their strength. But they
                    laugh loudly and heartily, and simple bodily pleasures—feasting, drinking, wrestling, drumming, and
                    wild dancing—fill their hearts with joy. They tend to be short-tempered and sometimes sullen, more
                    inclined to action than contemplation and to fighting than arguing. The most accomplished half-orcs
                    are those with enough self control to get by in a civilized land.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <div id="tribesAndSlums">
                <h5>Tribes and Slums</h5>
                <p>Half-orcs most often live among orcs. Of the other races, humans are most likely to accept half-orcs,
                    and half-orcs almost always live in human lands when not living among orc tribes. Whether proving
                    themselves among rough barbarian tribes or scrabbling to survive in the slums of larger cities,
                    half-orcs get by on their physical might, their endurance, and the sheer determination they inherit
                    from their human ancestry.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <div id="halfOrcNames">
                <h5>Half-Orc Names</h5>
                <p>Half-orcs usually have names appropriate to the culture in which they were raised. A half-orc who
                    wants to fit in among humans might trade an orc name for a human name. Some half-orcs with human
                    names decide to adopt a guttural orc name because they think it makes them more intimidating.</p>
                <p><span class="bold-text">Male Orc Names:</span> Dench, Feng, Gell, Henk, Holg, Imsh, Keth, Krusk,
                    Mhurren, Ront, Shump, Thokk</p>
                <p><span class="bold-text">Female Orc Names:</span> Baggi, Emen, Engong, Kansif, Myev, Neega, Ovak,
