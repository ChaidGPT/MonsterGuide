            <h4>Traits</h4>
            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <p>Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and parcel of dwarven nature.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Constitution score increases by 2.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Age:</span> Dwarves mature at the sam e rate as humans, but they’re considered
                young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Alignment:</span> Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a
                well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that
                everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a just order.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Size:</span> Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150
                pounds. Your size is Medium.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text tip" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="The distance in feet that the character or monster can move in 1 round">Speed:</span> Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by
                wearing heavy armor.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Darkvision:</span> Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in
                dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and
                in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Dwarven Resilience:</span> You have advantage on saving throws against poison,
                and you have resistance against poison damage.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Dwarven Combat Training:</span> You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe,
                throwing hammer, and warhammer.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Tools Proficiency:</span> You gain proficiency with the artisan’s tools of your
                choice: smith’s tools, brewers' supplies, or mason’s tools.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Stonecunning:</span> Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to
                the origin of stonework, you are considered proficient in the History skill and add double your
                proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text tip" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="The ability of a character to understand, speak, and read different languages, facilitating communication and interaction with various cultures and creatures in the game world">Languages:</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is
                full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other
                language a dwarf might speak.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Subrace:</span> Two main subraces of dwarves populate the worlds of D&D: hill
                dwarves and mountain dwarves.</p>

            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <h6>Hill Dwarf</h6>
            <p>As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, and remarkable resilience. The gold dwarves of
                Faerun in their mighty southern kingdom are hill dwarves, as are the exiled Neidar and the debased Klar
                of Krynn in the Dragonlance setting.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Dwarven Toughness:</span> Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases
                by 1 every time you gain a level.</p>

            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <h6>Mountain Dwarf</h6>
            <p>As a mountain dwarf, you're strong and hardy, accustomed to a difficult life in rugged terrain. You’re
                probably on the tall side (for a dwarf), and tend toward lighter coloration. The shield dwarves of
                northern Faerun, as well as the ruling Hylar clan and the noble Daewar clan of Dragonlance, are mountain
                dwarves.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your Strength score increases by 2.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Dwarven Armor Training:</span> You have proficiency with light and medium armor.

            <div id="shortAndStout">
                <h5>Short and Stout</h5>
                <p>Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though
                    they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a
                    human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any
                    of the larger folk.</p>
                <p>Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are
                    light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is
                    usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their
                    beards highly and groom them carefully.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <div id="longMemoryLongGrudges">
                <h5>Long Memory, Long Grudges</h5>
                <p>Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often rem em ber a very
                    different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of
                    the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the
                    fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a
                    perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.</p>
                <p>Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with
                    stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their
                    ancestry back to the founding o f their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and
                    don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the
                    dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the
                    forge.</p>
                <p>Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to
                    the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense o f justice, and they are slow to forget
                    wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf’s entire clan, so
                    what begins as one dwarf’s hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <div id="clansAndKingdoms">
                <h5>Clans and Kingdoms</h5>
                <p>Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals
                    and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry,
                    and in some dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can’t find in their
                    mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings
                    frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are
                    welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them.</p>
                <p>The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves
                    who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan identities and affiliations, recognize
                    related dwarves, and invoke their ancestors’ names in oaths and curses. To be clanless is the worst
                    fate that can befall a dwarf.</p>
                <p>Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially weapon smiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some
                    become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after for their courage and loyalty.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <div id="godsGoldAndClan">
                <h5>Gods, Gold, and Clan</h5>
                <p>Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a desire for treasure—for its own
                    sake, for a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help others. Other dwarves are
                    driven by the com m and or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to bring
                    glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek
                    to restore a clan’s lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place
                    within the clan after having been exiled. Or a dwarf might search for the axe wielded by a mighty
                    ancestor, lost on the field of battle centuries ago.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <div id="dwarfNames">
                <h5>Dwarf Names</h5>
                <p>A dwarf’s name is granted by a clan elder, in accordance with tradition. Every proper dwarven name
                    has been used and reused down through the generations. A dwarf’s name belongs to the clan, not to
                    the individual.A dwarf who misuses or brings shame to a clan name is stripped of the name and
                    forbidden by law to use any dwarven name in its place.</p>
