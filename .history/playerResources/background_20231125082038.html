              <div class="card-body">
                <p>Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your wizard could have been a
                  sage or an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a
                  jester.</p>
                <p>Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character’s identity. The
                  most important question to ask about your background is what changed? Why did you stop doing whatever
                  your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting
                  gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don't you have more money? How did you learn the
                  skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?</p>
                <div class="light-horizontal-line"></div>
                <h6>Proficiencies</h6>
                <p>Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills. In addition, most backgrounds give a
                  character proficiency with one or more tools.</p>
                <p>If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a
                  different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.</p>
                <div class="light-horizontal-line"></div>
                <h6>Languages</h6>
                <p>Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by race.</p>
                <div class="light-horizontal-line"></div>
                <h6>Equipment</h6>
                <p>Each background provides a package of starting equipment. If you choose to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment from your background.</p>
                <div class="light-horizontal-line"></div>
                <h6>Suggested Characteristics</h6>
                <p>A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of your own creation.</p>
                <div class="light-horizontal-line"></div>
                <h6>Customizing a Background</h6>
                <p>You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or the
                  campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose
                  any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds.
                  You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear. (if you spend
                  coin, you cant also take the equipment package suggested for your class. ) finally, choose two
                  personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you cant find a feature that matches your
                  desired background, work with your dm to create one.</p>

                <p>You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, perform ing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric-performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.</p>
                <p>Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being and work with your DM to detail the nature of your religious service.</p>
                <p>Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny.</p>
                <div class="light-horizontal-line"></div>
                <p><span class="underline-text">Skill Proficiencies:</span> Insight, Religion</p>

                <p><span class="underline-text">Equipment:</span> : A holy sym bol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp</p>
                <div class="light-horizontal-line"></div>
                <h6>Feature: Shelter of the Faithful</h6>
                <p>As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.</p>
                <p>You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.</p>
                <div class="light-horizontal-line"></div>
                <h6>Suggested Characteristics</h6>
                <p>Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.</p>

                <p>You have always had a way with people. You know what makes them tick, you can tease out their hearts' desires after a few minutes of conversation, and with a few leading questions you can read them like they were children's books. It’s a useful talent, and one that you’re perfectly willing to use for your advantage.</p>
                <p>You know what people want and you deliver, or rather, you promise to deliver. Com m on sense should steer people away from things that sound too good to be true, but common sense seems to be in short supply when you’re around. The bottle of pink-colored liquid will surely cure that unseemly rash, this ointment—nothing more than a bit o f fat with a sprinkle of silver dust—can restore youth and vigor, and there’s a bridge in the city that just happens to be for sale. These marvels sound implausible, but you make them sound like the real deal.</p>

They reflect what people want to see, what they want to believe, and how they see the world. But their true selves are sometimes plagued by an uneasy conscience, an old enemy, or deep-seated trust issues.</p>

                <h6>Feature: By Popular Demand</h6>
                <p>You can always find a place to perform, usually in an inn or tavern but possibly with a circus, at a theater, or even in a noble’s court. At such a place, you receive free lodging and food of a modest or comfortable standard (depending on the quality of the establishment), as long as you perform each night. In addition, your performance makes you something of a local figure. When strangers recognize you in a town where you have performed, they typically take a liking to you.</p>

                <h6>Suggested Characteristics</h6>
                <p>Successful entertainers have to be able to capture and hold an audience’s attention, so they tend to have flamboyant or forceful personalities. They’re inclined toward the romantic and often cling to high-minded ideals about the practice of art and the appreciation of beauty.</p>

                <h6>Variant Entertainer: Gladiator</h6>
                <p>A gladiator is as much an entertainer as any minstrel or circus performer, trained to make the arts of combat into a spectacle the crowd can enjoy. This kind of flashy combat is your entertainer routine, though you might also have some skills as a tumbler or actor. Using your By Popular Demand feature, you can find a place to perform in any place that features combat for entertainment—perhaps a gladiatorial arena or secret pit fighting club. You can replace the musical instrument in your equipment package with an inexpensive but unusual weapon, such as a trident or net.</p>
