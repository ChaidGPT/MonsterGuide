      <p>Before the coming of the gods, aboleths lurked in primordial oceans and underground lakes. They reached out
         with their minds and seized control of the burgeoning life-forms of the mortal realm, making those creatures
         their slaves. Their dominance made them like gods. Then the true gods appeared, smashing the aboleth’s empire
         and freeing their slaves. Aboleths have never forgotten.</p>

            mucus. A creature that touches the aboleth or that hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it
            must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is diseased for 1d4 hours. The

            Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution
            saving throw or become diseased. The disease has no effect for 1 minute and can be removed by any magic that
            cures disease. After 1 minute, the diseased creature’s skin becomes translucent and slimy, the creature
            can’t regain hit points unless it is underwater, and the disease can be removed only by heal or another
            disease-curing spell of 6th level or higher. When the creature is outside a body of water, it takes 6 (1d12)
            acid damage every 10 minutes unless moisture is applied to the skin before 10 minutes have passed.</p>
         <p><span class="bold-text">Tail:</span> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +9 to hit, reach 10 ft. one target. Hit:
            15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.</p>
         <p><span class="bold-text">Enslave (3/Day):</span> The aboleth targets one creature it can see within 30 feet
            of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed by the aboleth until
            the aboleth dies or until it is on a different plane of existence from the target. The charmed target is
            under the aboleth’s control and can’t take reactions, and the aboleth and the target can communicate
            telepathically with each other over any distance.</p>
         <p>Whenever the charmed target takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect
            ends. No more than once every 24 hours, the target can also repeat the saving throw when it is at least 1
            mile away from the aboleth.</p>
         <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
         <h5>Legendary Actions</h5>
         <p>The aboleth can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option
            can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The aboleth regains spent legendary
            actions at the start of its turn.</p>
         <p><span class="bold-text">Detect:</span> The aboleth makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.</p>
         <p><span class="bold-text">Tail Swipe:</span> The aboleth makes one tail attack.</p>
         <p><span class="bold-text">Psychic Drain (Costs 2 Actions):</span> One creature charmed by the aboleth takes 10
            (3d6) psychic damage, and the aboleth regains hit points equal to the damage the creature takes.</p>

            <p>Aboleths have flawless memories. They pass on their knowledge and experience from generation to
               generation. Thus, the injury of their defeat by the gods remains perfectly preserved in their minds.</p>
            <p>Aboleths' minds are treasure troves of ancient lore, recalling moments from prehistory with perfect
               clarity. They plot patiently and intricately across eons. Few creatures can conceive of the extent of an
               aboleth's plan.</p>

            <p>Aboleths dwell in watery environments, including ocean abysses, deep lakes, and the Elemental Plane of
               Water. In these domains and the lands that adjoin them, aboleths are like gods, demanding worship and
               obedience from their subjects. When they consume other creatures, aboleths add the knowledge and
               experiences of their prey to their eternal memories.</p>
            <p>Aboleths use their telepathic powers to read the minds of creatures and know their desires. An aboleth
               uses this knowledge to gain a creature's loyalty, promising to fulfill such wants in exchange for
               obedience. Within its lair, the aboleth can further use its powers to override senses, granting
               creatures, such as its followers, the illusion of promised rewards.</p>

               new body coalesces for it over days or months.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, aboleths dream of overthrowing the gods and regaining control of the world. Aboleths have had
               untold eons to plot and to prepare their plans for perfect execution.</p>

            <h5>An Aboleth's Lair</h5>
            <p>Aboleths lair in subterranean lakes or the rocky depths of the ocean, often surrounded by the ruins of an
               ancient, fallen aboleth city. An aboleth spends most of its existence underwater, surfacing occasionally
               to treat with visitors or deranged worshipers.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Lair Actions:</span> When fighting inside its lair, an aboleth can invoke the
               ambient magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the aboleth takes a
               lair action to cause one of the following effects:</p>
            <p>- The aboleth casts phantasmal force (no components required) on any number of creatures it can see
               within 60 feet of it. While maintaining concentration on this effect, the aboleth can't take other lair
               actions. If a target succeeds on the saving throw or if the effect ends for it, the target is immune to
               the aboleth's phantasmal force lair action for the next 24 hours, although such a creature can choose to
               be affected.</p>
            <p>- Pools of water within 90 feet of the aboleth surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the
               ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20
               feet into the water and knocked prone. The aboleth can't use this lair action again until it has used a
               different one.</p>
            <p>- Water in the aboleth's lair magically becomes a conduit for the creature's rage. The aboleth can target
               any number of creatures it can see in such water within 90 feet of it. A target must succeed on a DC 14
               Wisdom saving throw or take 7 (2d6) psychic damage. The aboleth can't use this lair action again until it
               has used a different one.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
         <div id="reginalEffects">
            <h5>Reginal Effects</h5>
            <p>The region containing an aboleth's lair is warped by the creature's presence, which creates one or more
               of the following effects:</p>
            <p>- Underground surfaces within 1 mile of the aboleth's lair are slimy and wet and are difficult terrain.
            </p>
            <p>- Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. Enemies of the aboleth that drink
               such water vomit it within minutes.</p>
            <p>- As an action, the aboleth can create an illusory image of itself within 1 mile of the lair. The copy
               can appear at any location the aboleth has seen before or in any location a creature charmed by the
               aboleth can currently see. Once created, the image lasts for as long as the aboleth maintains
               concentration, as if concentrating on a spell. Although the image is intangible, it looks, sounds, and
               can move like the aboleth. The aboleth can sense, speak, and use telepathy from the image's position as
               if present at that position. If the image takes any damage, it disappears.</p>
            <p>If the aboleth dies, the first two effects fade over the course of 3d 10 days.</p>
