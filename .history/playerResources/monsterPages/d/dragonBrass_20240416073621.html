      <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
      <p>The most gregarious of the true dragons, brass dragons crave conversation, sunlight, and hot, dry climates.</p>
      <p>A brass dragon's head is defined by the broad protective plate that expands from its forehead and the spikes
         protruding from its chin. A frill runs the length of its neck, and its tapering wings extend down the length of
         its tail. A brass dragon wyrmling's scales are a dull, mottled brown. As it ages, the dragon's scales begin to
         shine, eventually taking on a warm, burnished luster. Its wings and frills are mottled green toward the edges,
         darkening with age. As a brass dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble molten metal orbs.

         <h5>Actions</h5>
         <p><span class="bold-text">Multiattack:</span> The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.</p>
         <p><span class="bold-text">Bite:</span> Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 15ft., one target. Hit: 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage.</p>
         <p><span class="bold-text">Claw:</span> Melee Weapon Attack:+ 14 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage.</p>
         <p><span class="bold-text">Tail:</span> Melee Weapon Attack:+ 14 to hit, reach 20ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.</p>
         <p><span class="bold-text">Frightful Presence:</span> Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.</p>
         <p><span class="bold-text">Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6):</span> The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons:</p>
         <p><span class="bold-text">Fire Breath:</span> The dragon exhales fire in an 90-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 56 (16d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
         <p><span class="bold-text">Sleep Breath:</span> The dragon exhales sleep gas in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 10 minutes. This effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage or someone uses an action to wake it.</p>
         <p><span class="bold-text">Change Shape:</span> The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon's choice).</p>
         <p>In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.</p>

         <div class="light-horizontal-line"></div>
         <h5>Legendary Actions</h5>
         <p>The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option
            can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary
            actions at the start of its turn.</p>
         <p><span class="bold-text">Detect:</span> The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.</p>
         <p><span class="bold-text">Tail Attack:</span> The dragon makes a tail attack.</p>
         <p><span class="bold-text">Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions):</span> The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.</p>

         <p><span class="bold-text">Fire Breath:</span> The dragon exhales fire in an 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 49 (13d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
         <p><span class="bold-text">Sleep Breath:</span> The dragon exhales sleep gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 10 minutes. This effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage or someone uses an action to wake it.</p>

         <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
         <h5>Legendary Actions</h5>
         <p>The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>
         <p><span class="bold-text">Detect:</span> The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.</p>
         <p><span class="bold-text">Tail Attack:</span> The dragon makes a tail attack.</p>
         <p><span class="bold-text">Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions):</span> The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.</p>

         <div id="1">
            <h5>Boldly Talkative</h5>
            <p>A brass dragon engages in conversations with thousands of creatures throughout its long life,
               accumulating useful information which it will gladly share for gifts of treasure. If an intelligent
               creature tries to leave aÂ·brass dragon's presence without engaging in conversation, the dragon follows
               it. If the creature attempts to escape by magic or force, the dragon might respond with a fit of pique,
               using its sleep gas to incapacitate the creature. When it wakes, the creature finds itself pinned to the
               ground by giant claws or buried up to its neck in the sand while the dragon's thirst for small talk is
               slaked.</p>
            <p>A brass dragon is trusting of creatures that appear to enjoy conversation as much as it does, but is
               smart enough to know when it is being manipulated. When that happens, tne dragon often responds in kind,
               treating a bout of mutual trickery as a game.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
         <div id="2">
            <h5>Prized Treasures</h5>
            <p>Brass dragons covet magic items that allow them to converse with interesting personalities. An
               intelligent telepathic weapon or a magic lamp with a djinni bound inside it are among the greatest
               treasures a brass dragon can possess.</p>
            <p>Brass dragons conceal their hoards under mounds of sand or in secret places far from their primary lairs.
               They have no trouble remembering where their treasure is buried, and therefore have no need for maps.
               Adventurers and wanderers should be wary if they happen across a chest hidden in an oasis or a treasure
               cache tucked away in a half-buried desert ruin, for these might be parts of a brass dragon's hoard.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
         <div id="3">
            <h5>A Brass Dragon's Lair</h5>
            <p>A brass dragon's desert lair is typically a ruin, canyon, or cave network with ceiling holes to allow for
               sunlight.</p>
            <h5>Lair Actions</h5>
            <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the
               following effects:</p>
            <p>- A strong wind blows around the dragon. Each creature within 60 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC
               15 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from the dragon and knocked prone. Gases and vapors
               are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames; such as lanterns,
               have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished.</p>
            <p>- A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within
               120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in it must succeed on a DC 15
               Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end
               of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>
            <h5>Reginal Effects</h5>
            <p>The region containing a legendary brass dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one
               or more of the following effects:</p>
            <p>- Tracks appear in the sand within 6 miles of the dragon's lair. The tracks lead to safe shelters and
               hidden water sources, while also leading away from areas that the dragon prefers to remain undisturbed.
            </p>
            <p>- Images of Large or smaller monsters haunt the desert sands within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. These
               illusions move and appear real, although they can do no harm. A creature that examines an image from a
               distance can tell it's an illusion with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Any
               physical interaction with an image reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it.</p>
            <p>- Whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher comes within 30 feet of a water source within 1
               mile of the dragon's lair, the dragon becomes aware of the creature's presence and location.</p>
            <p>If the dragon dies, the tracks fade in 1d10 days, but the other effects fade immediately.</p>
