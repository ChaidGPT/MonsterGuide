        Devils personify tyranny, with a totalitarian society dedicated to the
        domination of mortal life. The shadow of the Nine Hells of Baator
        extends far across the multiverse, and Asmodeus, the dark lord of Ness
        us, strives to subjugate the cosmos to satisfy his thirst for power. To
        do so, he must continually expand his infernal armies, sending his
        servants to the mortal realm to corrupt the souls from which new devils
        are spawned.

          <h5>Lords of Tyranny</h5>
          <p>
            Devils live to conquer, enslave, and oppress. They take perverse
            delight in exercising authority over the weak, and any creature that
            defies the authority of a devil faces swift and cruel punishment.
            Every interaction is an opportunity for a devil to display its
            power, and all devils have a keen understanding of how to use and
            abuse their power.
          </p>
          <p>
            Devils understand the failings that plague intelligent mortals, and
            they use that knowledge to lead mortals into temptation and
            darkness, turning creatures into slaves to their own corruption.
            Devils on the Material Plane use their influence to manipulate
            humanoid rulers, whispering evil thoughts, fomenting paranoia, and
            eventually driving them to tyrannical actions.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
        <div id="2">
          <h5>Obedience and Ambition</h5>
          <p>
            In accordance with their lawful alignment, devils obey even when
            they envy or dislike their superiors, knowing that their obedience
            will be rewarded. The hierarchy of the Nine Hells depends on this
            unswerving loyalty, without which that fiendish plane would become
            as anarchic as the Abyss.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, it is in the nature of devils to scheme, creating
            in some a desire to rule that eclipses their contentment to be
            ruled. This singular ambition is strongest among the archdevils whom
            Asmodeus appoints to rule the nine layers of the Nine Hells. These
            high-ranking fiends are the only devils to ever sample true power,
            which they crave like the sweetest ambrosia.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
        <div id="3">
          <h5>Dark Dealers and Soul Mongers</h5>
          <p>
            Devils are confined to the Lower Planes, but they can travel beyond
            those planes by way of portals or powerful summoning magic. They
            love to strike bargains with mortals seeking to gain some benefit or
            prize, but a mortal making such a bargain must be wary. Devils are
            crafty negotiators and positively ruthless at enforcing the terms of
            an agreement. Moreover, a contract with even the lowliest devil is
            enforced by Asmodeus's will. Any mortal creature that breaks such a
            contract instantly forfeits its soul, which is spirited away to the
            Nine Hells.
          </p>
          <p>
            To own a creature's soul is to have absolute control over that
            creature, and most devils accept no other currency in exchange for
            the fiendish power and boons they can provide. A soul is usually
            forfeited when a mortal dies naturally, for devils are immortal and
            can wait years for a contract to play out. If a contract allows a
            devil to claim a mortal's soul before death, it can instantly return
            to the Nine Hells with the soul in its possession. Only divine
            intervention can release a soul after a devil has claimed it.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
        <div id="4">
          <h5>The Infernal Hierarch</h5>
          <p>
            The Nine Hells has a rigid hierarchy that defines every aspect of
            its society. Asmodeus is the supreme ruler of all devils, and the
            only creature in the Nine Hells with the powers of a lesser god.
            Worshiped as such in the Material Plane, Asmodeus inspires the evil
            humanoid cults that take his name. In the Nine Hells, he commands
            scores of pit fiend generals, which in turn command legions of
            subordinates.
          </p>
          <p>
            A supreme tyrant, a brilliant deceiver, and a master of subtlety,
            Asmodeus protects his throne by keeping his friends close and his
            enemies closer. He delegates most matters of rulership to the pit
            fiends and lesser arch devils that make up the infernal bureaucracy
            of the Nine Hells, even as he knows that those powerful devils
            conspire to usurp the Throne of Baa tor from which he rules.
            Asmodeus appoints archdevils, and he can strip any member of the
            infernal hierarchy of rank and status as he likes.
          </p>
          <p>
            If it dies outside the Nine Hells, a devil disappears in a cloud of
            sulfurous smoke or dissolves into a pool of ichor, instantly
            returning to its home layer, where it reforms at full strength.
            Devils that die in the Nine Hells are destroyed forever- a fate that
            even Asmodeus fears.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="bold-text">Archdevils:</span> The archdevils include
            all the current and deposed rulers of the Nine Hells (see the Layers
            and Lords of the Nine Hells table), as well as the dukes and
            duchesses that make up their courts, attend them as advisers, and
            hope to supplant them. Every archdevil is a unique being with an
            appearance that reflects its particular evil nature.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="bold-text">Greater Devils:</span> The greater devils
            include the pit fiends, erinyes, horned devils, and ice devils that
            command lesser devils and attend the archdevils.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="bold-text">Lesser Devils:</span> The lesser devils
            include numerous strains of fiends, including imps, chain devils,
            spined devils, bearded devils, barbed devils, and bone devils.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="bold-text">Lemures:</span> The lowest form of devil,
            lemures are the twisted and tormented souls of evil and corrupted
            mortals. A lemure killed in the Nine Hells is only permanently
            destroyed if it is killed with a blessed weapon or if its shapeless
            corpse is splashed with holy water before it can return to life.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="bold-text">Promotion and Demotion:</span> When the soul
            of an evil mortal sinks into the Nine Hells, it takes on the
            physical form of a wretched lemure. Archdevils and greater devils
            have the power to promote lemures to lesser devils. Archdevils can
            promote lesser devils to greater devils, and Asmodeus alone can
            promote a greater devil to archdevil status. This diabolic promotion
            invokes a brief, painful transformation, with the devil's memories
            passing intact from one form to the next.
          </p>
          <p>
            Low-level promotions are typically based on need, such as when a pit
            fiend transforms lemures into imps to gain invisible spies under its
            command. High-level promotions are almost always based on merit,
            such as when a bone devil that distinguishes itself in battle is
            transformed into a horned devil by the archdevil it serves. A devil
            is seldom promoted more than one step at a time in the hierarchy of
            infernal forms.
          </p>

          <h5>The Nine Hells</h5>
          <p>
            The Nine Hells are a single plane comprising nine separate layers.
            The first eight layers are each ruled by arch devils that answer to
            the greatest archdevil of all: Asmodeus, the Archduke of Nessus, the
            ninth layer. To reach the deepest layer of the Nine Hells, one must
            descend through all eight of the layers above it, in order. The most
            expeditious means of doing so is the River Styx, which plunges ever
            deeper as it flows from one layer to the next. Only the most
            courageous adventurers can withstand the torment and horror of that
            journey.
