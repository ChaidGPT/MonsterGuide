                <h5>Lords of Tyranny</h5>
                <p>
                    Devils live to conquer, enslave, and oppress. They take perverse
                    delight in exercising authority over the weak, and any creature that
                    defies the authority of a devil faces swift and cruel punishment.
                    Every interaction is an opportunity for a devil to display its
                    power, and all devils have a keen understanding of how to use and
                    abuse their power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Devils understand the failings that plague intelligent mortals, and
                    they use that knowledge to lead mortals into temptation and
                    darkness, turning creatures into slaves to their own corruption.
                    Devils on the Material Plane use their influence to manipulate
                    humanoid rulers, whispering evil thoughts, fomenting paranoia, and
                    eventually driving them to tyrannical actions.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <div id="2">
                <h5>Obedience and Ambition</h5>
                <p>
                    In accordance with their lawful alignment, devils obey even when
                    they envy or dislike their superiors, knowing that their obedience
                    will be rewarded. The hierarchy of the Nine Hells depends on this
                    unswerving loyalty, without which that fiendish plane would become
                    as anarchic as the Abyss.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the same time, it is in the nature of devils to scheme, creating
                    in some a desire to rule that eclipses their contentment to be
                    ruled. This singular ambition is strongest among the archdevils whom
                    Asmodeus appoints to rule the nine layers of the Nine Hells. These
                    high-ranking fiends are the only devils to ever sample true power,
                    which they crave like the sweetest ambrosia.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="3">
                <h5>Dark Dealers and Soul Mongers</h5>
                <p>
                    Devils are confined to the Lower Planes, but they can travel beyond
                    those planes by way of portals or powerful summoning magic. They
                    love to strike bargains with mortals seeking to gain some benefit or
                    prize, but a mortal making such a bargain must be wary. Devils are
                    crafty negotiators and positively ruthless at enforcing the terms of
                    an agreement. Moreover, a contract with even the lowliest devil is
                    enforced by Asmodeus's will. Any mortal creature that breaks such a
                    contract instantly forfeits its soul, which is spirited away to the
                    Nine Hells.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To own a creature's soul is to have absolute control over that
                    creature, and most devils accept no other currency in exchange for
                    the fiendish power and boons they can provide. A soul is usually
                    forfeited when a mortal dies naturally, for devils are immortal and
                    can wait years for a contract to play out. If a contract allows a
                    devil to claim a mortal's soul before death, it can instantly return
                    to the Nine Hells with the soul in its possession. Only divine
                    intervention can release a soul after a devil has claimed it.

            <div id="4">
                <h5>The Infernal Hierarch</h5>
                <p>
                    The Nine Hells has a rigid hierarchy that defines every aspect of
                    its society. Asmodeus is the supreme ruler of all devils, and the
                    only creature in the Nine Hells with the powers of a lesser god.
                    Worshiped as such in the Material Plane, Asmodeus inspires the evil
                    humanoid cults that take his name. In the Nine Hells, he commands
                    scores of pit fiend generals, which in turn command legions of
                    subordinates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A supreme tyrant, a brilliant deceiver, and a master of subtlety,
                    Asmodeus protects his throne by keeping his friends close and his
                    enemies closer. He delegates most matters of rulership to the pit
                    fiends and lesser arch devils that make up the infernal bureaucracy
                    of the Nine Hells, even as he knows that those powerful devils
                    conspire to usurp the Throne of Baa tor from which he rules.
                    Asmodeus appoints archdevils, and he can strip any member of the
                    infernal hierarchy of rank and status as he likes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If it dies outside the Nine Hells, a devil disappears in a cloud of
                    sulfurous smoke or dissolves into a pool of ichor, instantly
                    returning to its home layer, where it reforms at full strength.
                    Devils that die in the Nine Hells are destroyed forever- a fate that
                    even Asmodeus fears.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="bold-text">Archdevils:</span> The archdevils include
                    all the current and deposed rulers of the Nine Hells (see the Layers
                    and Lords of the Nine Hells table), as well as the dukes and
                    duchesses that make up their courts, attend them as advisers, and
                    hope to supplant them. Every archdevil is a unique being with an
                    appearance that reflects its particular evil nature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="bold-text">Greater Devils:</span> The greater devils
                    include the pit fiends, erinyes, horned devils, and ice devils that
                    command lesser devils and attend the archdevils.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="bold-text">Lesser Devils:</span> The lesser devils
                    include numerous strains of fiends, including imps, chain devils,
                    spined devils, bearded devils, barbed devils, and bone devils.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="bold-text">Lemures:</span> The lowest form of devil,
                    lemures are the twisted and tormented souls of evil and corrupted
                    mortals. A lemure killed in the Nine Hells is only permanently
                    destroyed if it is killed with a blessed weapon or if its shapeless
                    corpse is splashed with holy water before it can return to life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="bold-text">Promotion and Demotion:</span> When the soul
                    of an evil mortal sinks into the Nine Hells, it takes on the
                    physical form of a wretched lemure. Archdevils and greater devils
                    have the power to promote lemures to lesser devils. Archdevils can
                    promote lesser devils to greater devils, and Asmodeus alone can
                    promote a greater devil to archdevil status. This diabolic promotion
                    invokes a brief, painful transformation, with the devil's memories
                    passing intact from one form to the next.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Low-level promotions are typically based on need, such as when a pit
                    fiend transforms lemures into imps to gain invisible spies under its
                    command. High-level promotions are almost always based on merit,
                    such as when a bone devil that distinguishes itself in battle is
                    transformed into a horned devil by the archdevil it serves. A devil
                    is seldom promoted more than one step at a time in the hierarchy of
                    infernal forms.

                    The Nine Hells are a single plane comprising nine separate layers.
                    The first eight layers are each ruled by arch devils that answer to
                    the greatest archdevil of all: Asmodeus, the Archduke of Nessus, the
                    ninth layer. To reach the deepest layer of the Nine Hells, one must
                    descend through all eight of the layers above it, in order. The most
                    expeditious means of doing so is the River Styx, which plunges ever
                    deeper as it flows from one layer to the next. Only the most
                    courageous adventurers can withstand the torment and horror of that
                    journey.
