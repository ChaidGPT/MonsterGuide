        <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
        <p class="lead">Tiny undead, neutral evil</p>
        <p>The immortality granted to a lich lasts only as long as it feeds mortal souls to its phylactery. If it
            falters or fails in that task, its bones turn to dust until only its skull remains. This "demilich" contains
            only a fragment of the lich's malevolent life force- just enough so that if it is disturbed, these remains
            rise into the air and assume a wraithlike form. The skull then emits a terrifying howl that can slay the
            weak-hearted and leave others trembling with fear. Left alone, it sinks back down and returns to the empty
            peace of its existence.</p>
        <p>Few liches seek to become demiliches, for it means an end to the existence they hoped to preserve by becoming
            undead. However, time can erode the lich's reason and memory, causing it to retreat into its ancient tomb
            and forget to feed on souls. The spells it once knew fade from its mind, and it no longer channels the
            arcane energy it wielded as a lich. However, even as a mere skull it remains a deadly and vexing enemy.</p>

            <p><span class="bold-text">Legendary Resistance (3/Day):</span> If the demilich fails a saving throw, it can

            <h5>Actions</h5>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Howl (Recharge 5-6):</span> The demilich emits a bloodcurdling howl. Each
                creature within 30 feet of the demilich that can hear the howl must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
                saving throw or drop to 0 hit points. On a successful save, the creature is frightened until the end of
                its next turn.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Life Drain:</span> The demilich targets up to three creatures that it can see
                within 10 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or take 21 (6d6)
                necrotic damage, and the demilich regains hit points equal to the total damage dealt to all targets.</p>

            <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
            <h5>Legendary Actions</h5>
            <p>The demilich can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action
                option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The demilich regains spent
                legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Flight:</span> The demilich flies up to half its flying speed.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Cloud of Dust:</span> The demilich magically swirls its dusty remains. Each
                creature within 10 feet of the demilich, including around a corner, must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
                saving throw or be blinded until the end of the demilich's next turn. A creature that succeeds on the
                saving throw is immune to this effect until the end of the demilich's next turn.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Energy Drain (Costs 2 Actions):</span> Each creature within 30 feet of the
                demilich must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's hit point maximum
                is magically reduced by 10 (3d6). If a creature's hit point maximum is reduced to 0 by this effect, the
                creature dies. A creature's hit point maximum can be restored with the greater restoration spell or
                similar magic.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">Vile Curse (Costs 3 Actions):</span> The demilich targets one creature it can see
                within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be magically cursed.
                Until the curse ends, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws. The target can
                repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the curse on a success.</p>

                    the creature to its wretched state. If it has the presence of mind to do so, a demilich can reclaim
                    its former power by feeding just one soul to its phylactery. Doing so restores the demilich to lich
                    form, reconstituting its undead body.</p>

                <h5>A Demilich's Lair</h5>
                <p>A demilich hides its earthly remains and treasures in a labyrinthine tomb guarded by monsters and
                    traps. At the heart of this labyrinth rests the demilich's skull and the dust from its other bones.
                </p>
                <p>In its crypt, a demilich has access to lair actions and additional uses for its legendary actions.
                    Its whole lair also has unique traits. A demilich in its lair has a challenge rating of 20 (24,500
                    XP).</p>
                <h6>Lair Actions</h6>
                <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the demilich rolls a d20. On a result of 11 or
                    higher, the demilich takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects. It can't use the
                    same effect two rounds in a row.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The tomb trembles violently for a moment. Each creature on the floor of the tomb must succeed on
                        a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.</li>
                    <li>The demilich targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. An antimagic field fills the
                        space of the target, moving with it until initiative count 20 on the next round.</li>
                    <li>The demilich targets any number of creatures it can see within 30 feet of it. No target can
                        regain hit points until initiative count 20 on the next round.</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Lair Traits</h6>
                <p>A demilich's tomb might have any or all of the following effects in place:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The first time a non-evil creature enters the tomb's area, the creature takes 16 (3d10) necrotic
                        damage.</li>
                    <li>Monsters in the tomb have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened, and
                        against features that turn undead.</li>
                    <li>The tomb is warded against the magical travel of creatures the demilich hasn't authorized. Such
                        creatures can't teleport into or out of the tomb's area or use planar travel to enter or leave
                        it. Effects that allow teleportation or planar travel work within the tomb as long as they
                        aren't used to leave or enter the tomb's area.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If the demilich is destroyed, these effects fade over the course of 10 days</p>
