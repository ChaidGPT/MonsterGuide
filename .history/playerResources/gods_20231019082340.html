            The gods that make up the pantheon of Faer&ucirc;n are much like the
            population of some of the Realms' greatest cities: an eclectic blend
            of individuals from a variety of sources. The makeup of the pantheon
            has shifted over the ages, as a result of changes in the Realms and
            its people (or vice versa, depending on which scholars you believe).
            The following describe the most prominent members of the pantheon.

                    The rule of law and the glory of the sun are both in
                    Amaunator's dominion. His priests help establish
                    bureaucracies and lawful order in communities. They often
                    witness contracts and signed agreements, stamping such
                    documents with the sun-symbol of Amaunator to signify their
                    validity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    His priests teach that Amaunator has died and been reborn
                    time and again. Like the sun, he might pass into the realm
                    of darkness, but inevitably his bright gaze will fall on the
                    world once again. Amaunator is seen as a stern and
                    unforgiving deity, not unlike Silvanus in comportment, but
                    his concern isn't for the balance of life- he cares that
                    things proceed according to the celestial order, that
                    promises are kept, and that the rule of law persists.

                  <p>
                    Farmers and travelers beseech him when they pray for rain or
                    sun, as do any others looking for a favorable change in the
                    weather. But the most common form of propitiation to
                    Amaunator is the practice of swearing oaths, signing
                    contracts, and declaring laws under the light of the sun. So
                    ingrained in the common perception is the connection between
                    a solemn oath and the sun that those engaged in closing
                    deals or issuing edicts often pause and wait for a passing
                    cloud to clear the sun before completing the transaction or
                    pronouncement.

                    Open worship of Asmodeus began roughly a century ago when
                    small cults with charismatic leaders sprang up in the
                    aftermath of the Spell plague. That catastrophe left many
                    asking why the gods were angry or had abandoned them. To
                    those questioners, the faithful of Asmodeus provided answers
                    and a god who would forgive all their faults. Still, for the
                    next few decades, the cult of Asmodeus struggled for
                    acceptance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the beliefs of the people of the North- which coincide
                    with many tales told by dwarves, elves, and others- Asmodeus
                    is Lord of the Ninth, the leader of all devils of the Nine
                    Hells. People know devils to be iron-minded and
                    silver-tongued purveyors of temptation, whose price for
                    their boons can be as dear as one's soul. It's said that
                    when a soul waits on the Fugue Plane for a deity to take it
                    to its appropriate afterlife, devils approach the soul·and
                    offer it a chance at power and immortal pleasures. All a
                    soul needs to do is take one step out of the dust and the
                    milling crowd and put a foot on the first rung of the
                    infernal ladder that represents the hierarchy of the Nine
                    Hells.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The faithful of Asmodeus acknowledge that devils offer their
                    worshipers a path that's not for everyone- just as eternally
                    basking in the light of Lathander or endlessly swinging a
                    hammer in the mines of Moradin might not be for everyone.
                    Those who serve Asmodeus in life hope to be summoned out of
                    the moaning masses of the Fugue Plane after death. They
                    yearn for the chance to master their own fates, with all of
                    eternity to achieve their goals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To those not so dedicated, priests of Asmodeus offer the
                    prospect of a reprieve in the afterlife. All souls wait on
                    the Fugue Plane for a deity's pleasure, which determines
                    where a soul will spend the rest of eternity. Those who
                    lived their lives most in keeping with a deity's outlook are
                    taken first. Others, who have transgressed in the eyes of
                    their favored god or have not followed any particular ethos,
                    might wait centuries before Kelemvor judges where they go.
                    People who fear such a fate can pray to Asmodeus, his
                    priests say, and in return a devil will grant a waiting soul
                    some comfort.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Today, shrines to Asmodeus are still rare and temples are
                    almost unheard of, but many folk have adopted the habit of
                    asking Asmodeus for reprieve from their sins. After
                    transgressing against a god in some way, a person prays to
                    Asmodeus for something to provide respite during the long
                    wait. Asmodeus is known to grant people what they wish, and
                    thus people pray for all the delights and distractions they
                    desire most from life. Those who transgress in great ways
                    often ask Asmodeus to hide their sins from the gods, and
                    priests say that he will do so, but with a price after
                    death.

                    Auril, the merciless goddess of cold and winter, is
                    worshiped mostly in regions that are affected by deep
                    winters. Folk propitiate Auril with offerings and prayers
                    for mercy. Her priests warn others to prepare for winter,
                    and to stock extra provisions in order to have some to spare
                    as offerings to the goddess.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Few favor Auril except for those who make their livelihood
                    from winter or those who truly love the season. Her rare
                    priests tend to be folk who would, but for their status,
                    likely be outcasts from their communities. They practice
                    celibacy and remain aloof from others when not serving in
                    their official capacity.

                  <p>
                    Luskan has a temple dedicated to Auril, the whitespired
                    Winter Palace. The structure is a roofless array of pillars
                    and arches carved of white stone. The rituals of Auril's
                    worship often seem cruel to outsiders. In Luskan, visitors
                    gather at the temple to watch the frequent "wet parades," a
                    ritual in which supplicants don garments packed with ice.
                    They then journey between six white pillars known as the
                    Kisses of Auril, which are dispersed throughout the city.
                    The worshipers move from pillar to pillar, chanting prayers
                    to the goddess. Upon reaching a pillar, a supplicant must
                    climb it and then "kiss the lady," touching lips to a rusty
                    iron plate at the top. In winter, these events resemble
                    frantic footraces, with the added risk of frostbite and
                    injuries caused by falling from the slippery pillars. The
                    parade runners are cheered on by patrons who come out of
                    nearby taverns to place bets on the stamina of the
                    participants. Those who finish the race are thought to have
                    helped make the winter easier, and they rarely have to pay
                    for food or ale all winter long.

                    Few pay homage to Azuth aside from wizards. For them, the
                    High One is the ultimate embodiment of all that they hold
                    dear.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mystra serves as goddess of magic; Oghma is god of
                    knowledge; and Deneir is god of writing and language. Azuth
                    takes aspects of these general fields and applies them to
                    the specific practices of wizards. For instance, while
                    Mystra is the deity who represents the soul, art, and wonder
                    of magic, Azuth is god of a wizard's long hours of study,
                    exacting standards of movement and speech, and cramped,
                    ink-stained fingers. Wizards invoke Azuth when they scribe
                    scrolls, inscribe magic circles, attempt to memorize spells,
                    and even when they cast spells. Often this acknowledgment
                    comes in the form of silently forming Azuth's holy symbol,
                    pointing the index finger of the left hand to the sky. For
                    many wizards, the gesture is so commonplace in their lives
                    that it becomes an unconscious habit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Temples dedicated to Azuth are scarce, and clerics of the
                    deity are extremely rare. Even in magic-saturated Halruaa,
                    only a handful of holy places are dedicated to Azuth.
                    Sometimes a statue or a shrine dedicated to him stands in a
                    corner of a temple to Mystra or another deity. More often, a
                    wizard has a personal shrine at home. Azuth is represented
                    at such sites as a hooded and bearded figure with left hand
                    held high, finger pointed up. Sometimes he is represented by
                    merely the hand. In either case, the finger often serves as
                    a candleholder or as the point of origin for a light spell.

                    Bane has a simple ethos: the strong have not just the right
                    but the duty to rule over the weak. A tyrant who is able to
                    seize power must do so, for not only does the tyrant
                    benefit, but so do those under the tyrant's rule. When a
                    ruler succumbs to decadence, corruption, or decrepitude, a
                    stronger and more suitable ruler will rise.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Bane is vilified in many legends. Throughout history, those
                    who favor him have committed dark deeds in his name, but
                    most people don't worship Bane out of malice. Bane
                    represents ambition and control, and those who have the
                    former but lack the latter pray to him to give them
                    strength. It is said that Bane favors those who exhibit
                    drive and courage, and that he aids those who seek to become
                    conquerors, carving kingdoms from the wilderness, and
                    bringing order to the lawless.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At many times and in many places in Faer&ucirc;n, the
                    faithful of Bane have been seen as saviors for their efforts
                    in slaughtering raiders, throwing down corrupt rulers, or
                    saving armies on the brink of defeat. But in just as many
                    other places, the worship of Bane has created or supported
                    cruel dictatorships, aided mercantile monopolies, or brought
                    about the practice of slavery where before it didn't exist.

                    Beshaba is the counterpoint to Tymora and is just as
                    frequently acknowledged in daily life as is her more
                    benevolent "sister." She is seen as a cruel and capricious
                    goddess who must be propitiated to avoid attracting her
                    attention and interest in a negative way
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Beshaba's name is invoked when someone is beset by bad
                    luck-which could be as minor as stubbing a toe or breaking a
                    wagon wheel, or as catastrophic as slipping and accidentally
                    falling off a cliff. It is also invoked to ward off her
                    attentions when someone is doing something in which good
                    luck wouldn't play a part but bad luck might. For example,
                    someone rolling dice would invoke Tymora because they want
                    random chance to fall in their favor, but someone about to
                    cross a rickety bridge would ask Beshaba to keep the bridge
                    intact.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Folk make the symbol of Beshaba by folding in their thumbs
                    and extending their fingers on one or both hands (mimicking
                    the horns of her holy symbol) to ward off misfortune. The
                    same gesture raised to the head signifies a salute; when
                    pointed at someone, the "horns" indicate ill favor directed
                    toward that individual.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Many druids worship Beshaba as one of the First Circle. They
                    propitiate her with dances while wearing fire-blackened
                    antlers dipped in blood. According to these druids, her holy
                    symbol is the horns of a stag because when Beshaba was first
                    worshiped, humans were simple hunter-gatherers and she was
                    believed to bring misfortune to hunters, such as being gored
                    by a stag.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although most people tremble in fear at the prospect of
                    Beshaba's attendance at any event (even in spirit), Beshaba
                    is almost always invoked and welcomed formally in the
                    opening speeches or ceremonies of formal functions such as
                    marriages and coronations, contests of sport or martial
                    prowess, and at the naming ceremonies of children. If she
                    isn't invited to such an event, she might take offense and
                    wreak misfortune on those involved.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Temples to Beshaba are virtually unknown. It's common,
                    however, for rural folk to erect a post and mount antlers on
                    it at the site of some roadside accident or murder. In
                    cities, where antlers are hard to come by and murders and
                    accidents more prevalent, the fashion is to draw the black
                    antlers of Beshaba with charcoal on a nearby wall, leaving
                    the symbol on display until weather scours it away. These
                    "shrines," in either form, serve as warnings to others about
                    places of ill fortune.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    More formal shrines to Beshaba exist in places where folk
                    frequently hope to ward off misfortune. These sites tend to
                    be posts or stones painted red with blackened antlers
                    attached to them, or a red, triangular wallmounted plaque
                    with attached antlers. Both types have a stone or bronze
                    bowl where coins can be tossed or burnt offerings made. The
                    Red Wizards of Thay commonly erect such shrines outside
                    their ritual chambers to guard against unfortunate mistakes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Few dare to take Beshaba as a patron. The rare clerics of
                    the Maid of Misfortune are those who have been deeply
                    affected by great misfortunes and who seek to warn others of
                    the essential unfairness of life- or to inflict that
                    unfairness upon them.

                    The folk of Faer&ucirc;n don't normally pray to or
                    acknowledge Bhaal. He is seen as a deeply evil and
                    destructive deity who hungers for death- meaning the death
                    of any sentient beings through unlawful means.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some people pray to Bhaal when they want to commit murder. A
                    person might have good reason to resort to murder, such as
                    when one is unable to redress some injustice through lawful
                    means. But it's far more common for prayers to Bhaal to be
                    uttered by those who seek to kill someone out of jealousy,
                    greed, or wrath. It's rare for anyone but assassins or
                    compulsive killers to take Bhaal as a patron, and clerics
                    who revere Bhaal often qualify on both counts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Murder cults of Bhaal have arisen in the past, each led by a
                    charismatic, self-styled priest of Bhaal, but organized
                    worship of the Lord of Murder is extremely uncommon. Temples
                    and shrines are similarly rare. Those who erect a shrine to
                    Bhaal usually do so to thank him for a successful murder.
                    Such shrines typically feature a skull or a severed head
                    surrounded by drops of blood (often both from the murdered
                    victim).

                  <p>
                    Chauntea is goddess of agriculture: sowing and reaping,
                    seeding and harvest, breeding and butchery, shearing and
                    weaving. In this aspect she is a rural deity rarely prayed
                    to behind the walls of a city except by kitchen gardeners.
                    But Chauntea is also the Great Mother, a goddess of crib,
                    hearth, and home. And as such she is welcomed into all homes
                    at mealtimes and at the birth of children, and folk give her
                    thanks whenever they experience the pleasure of settling by
                    a fire and feeling safe and loved.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Chauntea's faith is one of nurturing and growth.
                    Agricultural aphorisms and farming parables dot her
                    teachings. Growing and reaping, the eternal cycle, is a
                    common theme in the faith. Destruction for its own sake, or
                    leveling without rebuilding, is anathema to her.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Temples of Chauntea maintain a great body of lore about
                    farming and cultivation. Her priests work closely with
                    communities in rural areas, and they are willing to roll up
                    their sleeves and dig their hands into the dirt.

                  <p>
                    The worship of Cyric derives directly from the story of his
                    ascension to godhood. Cyric was a mortal during the Time of
                    Troubles and the key to how that chaotic period resolved,
                    but he was also a selfish traitor and a murderer. When he
                    became a god, Cyric continued to work various plots of
                    deceit and murder- the most famous of which is that,
                    according to legend, Cyric murdered Mystra and thus caused
                    the Spellplague over a century ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Those who don't worship Cyric see him as a god of madness,
                    strife, and deceit, although his priests consider such
                    claims to be heresy. Their Prince of Lies isn't a twisted
                    madman, but a god of dark majesty who proves that,
                    ultimately, all bonds between folk corrupt and wither away.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cyric's church works openly in Arnn, where the citizens
                    espouse the principles of ambition, self-reliance, and
                    "buyer beware." Those who take Cyric as their patron tend to
                    be sadists, con artists, power-mad connivers, and worse.
                    Other folk pray to Cyric when they want to do wrong but
                    don't want others to find out about it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The Dark Sun," originally one of Cyric's epithets, has
                    become a metaphor for strife in the Realms. "A Dark Sun has
                    risen o'er this court" might be spoken as a warning that
                    intrigues and infighting have gotten out of hand in a noble
                    household; and married couples know to seek advice .from
                    others if "a Dark Sun shines through the window" in their
                    relationship.

                    Deneir is the god of literature and literacy, the patron of
                    the artist and the scribe. His is the power to accurately
                    render and describe, to write and to read, and to pass on
                    information. In legend, Deneir is often portrayed as being a
                    scribe in service to Oghma, and he is sometimes thought of
                    as Oghma's right hand.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's common practice for someone who writes a letter or
                    records information to say a prayer to Deneir to avoid
                    mistakes. Similarly, artists acknowledge Deneir before
                    beginning and upon completing paintings, particularly
                    illuminations on manuscripts, tapestries that relate
                    stories, and any such attempt to use art to capture the
                    truth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Followers of Deneir believe that information not recorded
                    and saved for later use is information lost. They consider
                    literacy an important gift of the gods, one that should be
                    spread and taught. His followers are scribes and scholars
                    devoted, like their patron, to preserving written works, and
                    also to experiencing them, for they say that Deneir himself
                    is hidden within the lines, shapes, and passages of all
                    written works. Priests of Deneir take an oath of charity as
                    well, compelling them to accept the requests of others to
                    write letters and transcribe information.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The god's followers tend to be individualists, united by
                    their shared faith but not overly concerned with religious
                    hierarchy and protocol. This behavior is supported by the
                    fact that Deneir's blessings of divine magic are more often
                    bestowed on those who lose themselves in written works than
                    on those who fancy themselves part of any temple or
                    religious order. Contemplation of the faith's most holy
                    book, the Tome of Universal Harmony, is the most effective
                    way to become deserving of Deneir's blessings.

                    present at many such places, particularly those that serve
                    as druid groves. Eldath is a goddess of comfort, healing,
                    and calm. Her blessed waters heal the sick, cure madness,
                    and comfort the dying.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most rural places have a pond or a glade that locals ascribe
                    to Eldath. Tradition dictates that it be a place of quiet
                    reflection where others are left to their thoughts. A body
                    of water such as a pond or a spring typically serves as a
                    repository of offerings. If the holy site is a glade, a
                    stream one crosses along the way might serve as the
                    repository, or a prominent bush or tree in the glade might
                    be the place where people tie offerings. Typical offerings
                    are broken weapons or items that are remembrances of
                    arguments, which the faithful discard while making a wish
                    for peace in the future. Many of those who favor Eldath are
                    pacifists or people who are troubled by violence they have
                    witnessed or experienced.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Eldath's priests don't organize into large sects. Indeed,
                    many are itinerant, wandering between various holy sites and
                    shrines, seeing that the locations are cared for and that
                    they remain places of sweet serenity. The faithful of Eldath
                    are usually close to nature, and allied to druids, who count
                    Eldath among the First Circle. It is taboo to strike a
                    priest of Eldath, and killing one is said to bring great
                    misfortune. Despite the measure of protection that this
                    belief affords them, most priests of Eldath avoid conflicts
                    rather than attempting to quell them. Those who serve Eldath
                    are happy to preside over peaceful negotiations and to
                    certify treaties, but they can't force others to engage in
                    harmony.

                    Gond is the god of artifice, craft, and construction. He is
                    revered by blacksmiths, woodworkers, engineers, and
                    inventors. Anyone who is crafting something might say a
                    prayer to Gond to guide the work, but folk know that Gond
                    smiles most brightly upon new inventions that others find
                    useful.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Priests of Gond wander the North dressed in saffron
                    vestments, adorned with sashes that contain within their
                    folds gears, locks, hooks, and bits of steel, tin, and wood
                    that might prove useful in a pinch. They also wear belts of
                    large, linked metal medallions and enormous sun hats. A
                    traveling priest of Gond offers services to distant villages
                    as a tinker, a carpenter, and a civil engineer rolled into
                    one, ready to help build a better paddock gate, dig a new
                    well, or mend pots or furniture that might otherwise go to
                    waste. All priests of Gond keep journals in which they
                    record ideas, inventions, and innovations discovered in
                    their travels, and take great delight in meeting fellow
                    priests and sharing their finds. In large cities, the Gondar
                    construct temples that serve as great workshops and
                    inventors' labs. Wandering priests turn their journals over
                    to the resident scribes at such temples, who then record the
                    priests' observations for posterity and the benefit of all
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most who favor Gond practice time-honored crafting
                    professions: they are smiths and engineers, architects and
                    weavers, leatherworkers and jewelers. Even so, this faith
                    has a well-earned reputation as a haven for crackpot
                    inventors and visionaries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The center of Gond's worship on the Sword Coast lies in
                    Baldur's Gate, where the faithful have erected two huge
                    structures in honor of the Wonderbringer: a temple called
                    the High House of Wonders and a museum of craft and design
                    called the Hall of Wonders. Lantan had been the preeminent
                    place of Gond's worship in the world until a century ago,
                    when the island nation disappeared, and since its return the
                    few Lantanese merchants seen in Sword Coast ports have said
                    little about the present state of their homeland.

                    Few aside from rangers of the North pray to Gwaeron
                    Windstrom. Said to have been a mortal man elevated to
                    godhood by Mielikki, Gwaeron serves rangers as their
                    intercessor with Mielikki. He is seen as a master ranger,
                    the perfect tracker, a peerless animal handler, and a
                    dedicated foe of rapacious creatures such as trolls and
                    ores. He is said to look like an old man with a long white
                    beard who is still hale and mighty, and he is believed to
                    take rest and sleep in a stand of trees near Triboar.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Rangers pray to Gwaeron because he represents much of the
                    work they do, and because he can speak to Mielikki on their
                    behalf. In the North, most rangers view Mielikki as too
                    mysterious, holy, and wild to be addressed directly with
                    their requests, but they consider Gwaeron Windstrom to be
                    one of them and thus understanding of their needs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Gwaeron has no temples, but shrines dedicated to him can be
                    found in many places that serve wilderness wanderers as
                    trail markers. Each one is denoted by a carving of Gwaeron's
                    symbol, a paw print with a star on the palm, on a prominent
                    tree or stone.

                    The god of vigilance and protection, Helm is seen as the
                    epitome of the guardian, the watcher, and the guard. He is
                    venerated by those who need to remain watchful for enemies
                    or danger. Helm is a favorite deity of people who make a
                    living by protecting someone or something, such as
                    bodyguards, members of the city watch, and the guards of a
                    treasury vault.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Helm embodies the spirit of watchfulness without regard to
                    good or evil. In legends, he is honorable and keeps his word
                    to a fault, such as when he guarded the celestial stairways
                    during the Time of Troubles, preventing the gods from
                    ascending them and continuing the chaos of that period,
                    until the Tablets of Fate were found.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although his faith has known dark days, worship of Helm
                    never truly faded away. Most of his followers believe that
                    the Watcher can never be vanquished utterly, and recent
                    events have borne out that assertion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Helm's priests teach that one must be ever vigilant, ever
                    aware, ever prepared for one's enemies. Patience, clear
                    thought, and careful planning will always defeat rushed
                    actions in the end. Those who favor Helm strive to be alert,
                    clear-headed, and true to their word. These traits don't
                    necessarily make them nice people, however, and as such many
                    consider the faithful of Helm to be inflexible and
                    merciless.

                    Hoar, known in the lands along the Inner Sea as Assuran, is
                    a god of revenge and retribution. He isn't typically
                    worshiped habitually, but his name is invoked by those who
                    seek vengeance. When a guilty party falls prey to fate- such
                    as when a murderer escapes prosecution, but is then
                    accidentally slain himself- the hand of Hoar is given
                    credit. When one hears three rolls of thunder in succession,
                    it is thought to be a sign from Hoar that some act of
                    vengeance has been performed. Many human societies have the
                    custom of ringing a bell or a gong three times when judgment
                    of a crime is rendered or an execution takes place.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Folk speak Hoar's name when they want revenge, particularly
                    when they are incapable of avenging themselves. This
                    invocation might be in response to a petty slight or a true
                    injustice, and the acknowledgment of Hoar might be a short
                    prayer said aloud or might be written down somewhere. It's
                    generally believed that the more permanent the form of the
                    prayer, the more likely it is to be fulfilled. For this
                    reason, some etch their prayers in lead and bury it or hide
                    their prayers inside diaries. Aside from bounty hunters and
                    those on crusades of vengeance, few truly revere Hoar, and
                    he is served by fewer still who would call themselves
                    priests. Temples or shrines of Hoar are almost nonexistent
                    except for ancient sites in Chessenta and Unther.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hoar became a member of the Faerfinian pantheon when his
                    worship extended beyond the lands that originally revered
                    him. Most consider Tyr to be the arbiter of laws, and Hoar
                    to be the god who metes out punishment that comes as a
                    result of breaking those codes. A judge might favor the
                    worship of Tyr, while a jail or or a headsman is more likely
                    to pray to Hoar.

                  <p>
                    Ilmater is the god of suffering, martyrdom, and
                    perseverance, renowned for his compassion and endurance. It
                    is he who offers succor and calming words to those who are
                    in pain, victimized, or in great need. He is the willing
                    sufferer, the one who takes the place of another to heft the
                    other's burden, to take the other's pain. He is the god of
                    the oppressed and the unjustly treated.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is said that if he had his way, the Crying God would take
                    all the suffering in the world onto himself, so as to spare
                    others. Since he can't, he blesses those who endure on
                    others' behalf, and he alleviates suffering when he can.
                    Martyrs who die that others may live are always blessed by
                    II mater with a final rest and reward in the god's
                    afterlife, should they so choose.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ilmater's priests take in the ill, the starving, and the
                    injured, and his temples give most of what they receive to
                    help offset the suffering of the world. His followers
                    provide succor when they can, but also use force to put an
                    end to torture and suffering inflicted on others. Ilmater's
                    priests travel to places where the worst possible conditions
                    exist, ministering to the needs of the oppressed, the
                    deceased, and the poor. They put others ahead of themselves,
                    are sharing of all they have, and emphasize the spiritual
                    nature of life over the welfare of the material body.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Priests of Ilmater who are on a quest to aid others can be
                    recognized by their hair shirts, vests of coarse fur worn
                    against the bare skin. It is taboo to harm such priests as
                    they go about their duties, such as when they administer to
                    the wounded on a battlefield. The taboo is so strongly felt
                    among humans that other races respect the custom. Even ores
                    and goblinoids will avoid directly attacking a peaceful
                    priest of Ilmater, as long as the priest administers to
                    their fallen warriors as well.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most folk deeply respect the work and the sacrifice of
                    Ilmater's faith, and lend aid to such endeavors where they
                    can. When a temple of Ilmater sends its faithful to help
                    refugees of war or victims of plague, their willingness to
                    sacrifice their own well-being always prompts ordinary
                    people to support them, whether they are inspired or shamed
                    into action.

                  <p>
                    Legend has it that Jergal is an ancient deity. The story
                    goes that in the time of Netheril he was worshiped as the
                    god of death, murder, and strife. Yet with the passing of
                    time, he became bored with his position. Then one day three
                    mortals, each a powerful adventurer, met Jergal in the lands
                    of the dead, determined to destroy him and take his power.
                    Instead,Jergal calmly abdicated his throne of bones and
                    allowed each of the three mortals to take part of his
                    divinity. Thus it was that Bane assumed the portfolio of
                    strife, Myrkul the rulership of the dead, and Bhaal the
                    portfolio of murder. Jergal lost his former stature and
                    became a scribe of the dead.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Jergal is now seen as an uncaring custodian of the dead. He
                    is thought to record the passing of the living and to aid
                    Kelemvor in seeing that souls are properly bound to their
                    appropriate afterlife. He is rarely acknowledged directly,
                    except for being mentioned at funerals and among those who
                    practice the custom of writing the name of the deceased on a
                    sheet of parchment and placing it in the corpse's mouth.
                    This rite is common in places where an individual's grave or
                    tomb isn't marked with the person's name.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Few people favor Jergal as a deity, and most who do are
                    concerned with the dispensation of the dead in some way.
                    Priests ofJergal serve communities as undertakers and
                    caretakers of gravesites. Jergal has no temples dedicated to
                    him aside from abandoned places devoted to his old, darker
                    incarnation, but his priests are welcome in the temples of
                    Kelemvor, Deneir, and Myrkul. His faithful send their annual
                    recordings of mortality to holy sites where records of that
                    sort are kept.

                    Kelemvor is seen as a just, fair, and comforting god of
                    death. Death comes to all, and when it occurs Kelemvor is
                    there to take each soul by the hand and lead it to the
                    proper afterlife. Kelemvor's priests teach that those who
                    revere the gods according to the rites of their religion
                    have done their proper service and will be offered the
                    afterlife they seek.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The faithful of Kelemvor provide people with peaceful
                    transitions into the care of the Lord of the Dead. They help
                    the dying put their affairs in order, and they officiate at
                    funeral rites for those who can't afford the lavish
                    ceremonies of their faith. The tenets of Kelemvor's faithful
                    compel them to forestall or prevent untimely deaths whenever
                    possible. Different sects and worshipers define "untimely"
                    in different ways. One group might concentrate on stopping
                    the spread of disease, another on the prevention of murder,
                    and yet another on eliminating the scourge of the undead. In
                    fact, all the faithful of Kelemvor despise the undead and
                    work to some degree to eliminate them, for undead of any
                    sort are seen as an abomination of the natural order. This
                    belief obviously puts Kelemvor's faithful at odds with
                    necromancers, priests of Myrkul, and others who promote the
                    creation of the undead, and it also causes conflict from
                    unexpected sources. For instance, priests of Kelemvor
                    routinely destroy any writings about the creation of the
                    undead that they find-an act that offends those who value
                    knowledge for its own sake, such as the faithful of Oghma
                    and Deneir. And there also exist undead that aren't evil,
                    such as the baelnorn, which the elves consider holy.
                    Kelemvor's devotees seek the end of such beings regardless
                    of that fact.

                    Lathander is the god of the spring, birth, and renewal, a
                    deity of conception, vitality, youth, renewal, and
                    self-perfection. He is god not of the sun but of the dawn,
                    which represents the start of a new day filled with
                    potential
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Lathander is a god of beginnings. People commonly offer a
                    prayer to him before undertaking any journey or endeavor.
                    Lathander's name is invoked to seal alliances and christen
                    new ventures or companies. As a result, the god is very
                    popular among the merchant classes, and the church has
                    benefited accordingly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The rising sun is his symbol, and his colors are the rose,
                    gold, and violet of the dawn. Lathander's temples and
                    shrines host a wide range of functions both municipal and
                    personal. At such places folk get married in dawn
                    ceremonies, announce the start of civic projects, and even
                    give birth when possible, to provide the baby good fortune.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The faithful of Lathander embrace the founding of new
                    communities and the growth of civilization, as long as that
                    civilization gives everyone the potential to succeed. They
                    despise the undead, seeing them as both a corruption of the
                    natural order and a disavowal of new beginnings, because
                    undead cling to their old existence rather than moving on.

                  <p>
                    Leira has worn many masks, and more than once has been
                    thought to be dead or to be another deity altogether.
                    Perhaps such a reputation is only natural for the goddess of
                    illusion and deception. Her faithful agree that whatever the
                    "truth" might be, their Lady takes great delight in the
                    confusion sown by her various incarnations. Even the
                    faithful of Cyric once taught that their god killed Leira,
                    but now they espouse the strange idea that somehow she is
                    his daughter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Leira isn't viewed as malicious or as a trickster but is
                    seen as enigmatic, quiet, and retiring. She is credited with
                    inventing Ruathlek, the language of illusionists and the
                    spoken tongue of Nimbral.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The faithful of Leira seem to be scarce, although it is
                    difficult to know this for certain, because those who favor
                    her rarely make their inclinations known. Leira is the
                    patron of illusionists and liars. She receives little
                    regular worship except from illusionists, who pray to the
                    Mistshadow for potency in their magic, and con artists, for
                    whom she is a kind of champion. Most people pray to her when
                    they hope to keep something secret, or placate her with a
                    prayer before making an important decision when they fear
                    being deceived. Some folk perform a swirling motion with a
                    finger behind their backs when telling a lie as a way of
                    beseeching her for aid.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Her priests wear vestments of white and mist-gray, and their
                    faces are covered by smooth, featureless masks. Only in
                    Nimbral do temples to Leira exist, and shrines dedicated to
                    her found across the continent are usually disguised
                    as-other kinds of sites, marked with signs that only the
                    faithful would recognize.

                  <p>
                    Lliira is a beloved goddess, a deity of contentment,
                    release, joy, happiness, dance, and freedom. As the patron
                    of festivals, she is honored at any celebration, and dance
                    is the primary way to worship her. The Mistress of Revels is
                    said to abhor violence, and any fighting or drawing of
                    weapons (except in ceremony) at a celebration will cause her
                    to withhold her favor. Her priests and priestesses, known as
                    joybringers, take it as their mission to make other people
                    happy, even if just for a moment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Her faithful a lways wear at least one clothing item of a
                    bright, cheerful color, and her priests' vestments have more
                    in common with festival attire than with somber ecclesial
                    garments. Rubies and sapphires are sacred to Our Lady of
                    Joy, and her priests bless anyone they see wearing s uch
                    adornments.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Lliira's followers aren't frivolous, however. To them,
                    divine joy is a very real gift to the world of mortals, and
                    one much needed. To that end, they fight those who would
                    bring misery to others. They are fierce against their foes,
                    and joyous revelers when their work is done.

                  <p>
                    Pain isn't a means to an end for Loviatar's faithful, but an
                    end unto itself. To them, nothing is as transcendent as
                    suffering, and all pain is holy, from the crudest barbarism,
                    to the most sublime torture, to the emotional suffering of
                    the heartbroken or the betrayed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The pain that one feels is proof of the Lady's attention,
                    and so her faithful are notorious self-flagellants. Pain is
                    also a path to power, in terms of both one's ability to
                    inflict it and one's ability to endure it. A cold, cruel
                    demeanor is considered ideal because it best emulates the
                    Scourge Mistress, and for the same reason her faithful
                    appreciate beauty, cultural refinement, and a certain
                    adeptness at manipulation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Though temples to Loviatar are rare, her faithful are more
                    numerous than might be expected. Loviatar is the chosen
                    deity of those who inflict pain as a matter of course,
                    including torturers and others who need to break the will of
                    their victims. She is favored by sadists and masochists, and
                    some of her followers form cultish cells of secret
                    adherents. Each of these groups is led by someone who takes
                    pleasure in administering pain and dominating others,
                    supported and backed up by a number of submissive
                    sycophants.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Worshipers of Loviatar rarely gather in numbers except in
                    the more populous cities. When small cadres of faithful
                    operate quietly in such places, few citizens take notice or
                    raise a fuss if they do witness cult activity. The sufferers
                    who endure the lash, however, aren't always willing
                    participants, and Lovatar's cults sometimes operate secret
                    slavery rings, which can draw the attention of the
                    authorities. The open worship of Loviatar and temples
                    clearly dedicated to her are rarely seen except in lands
                    where slavery is an accepted practice.

                    Malar epitomizes the dark side of nature, the world that is
                    red in tooth and claw. His faithful believe the hunt is the
                    center point between life and death- the facing off of
                    hunter and prey, forcing the issue of who lives and who
                    dies. People believe that Malar can't be propitiated and
                    knows no mercy, so he receives prayers only from those
                    engaging in a hunt. Such supplicants pray to Malar for two
                    reasons: to beg the aid of his peerless skill as a hunter,
                    or to adopt his fearsome mantle and thus ward off other
                    predators. Malar is the god of those who delight in the
                    hunt, don't shy from bloodshed, and savor the fear of their
                    prey.
                  </p>

                    Many lycanthropes consider Malar to be their divine father,
                    as do some other intelligent predators. He has many devotees
                    who are druids and rangers of particularly savage
                    inclination, and many barbarians take Malar as a patron for
                    his ferocity and cruelty. His priests use claw bracers,
                    impressive gauntlets bedecked with stylized claws that jut
                    out from the ends of the fists, as ceremonial weapons.

                    Mask is a trickster god, the patron of ne'er-do-wells,
                    spies, and thieves. All that occurs within shadow is in the
                    purview of Mask. People whisper a prayer to Mask whenever
                    stealth is required or intrigue is afoot. Courtiers and
                    diplomats invoke the god's name in hopes of a smooth
                    negotiation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Those who favor Mask usually pursue thievery and other forms
                    of acquisition of what belongs to others, such as
                    pickpocketing, burglary, mugging, and con games. Ordinary
                    folk pray to him to avert his eyes from their valuables, but
                    the cautious sometimes employ "Mask's purse," a small, cheap
                    cloth pouch worn in plain sight (thus easily cut or lifted)
                    containing a small offering of coin. By convention, a
                    pickpocket pilfers Mask's purse when encountering another
                    person wearing one, and considers the gain a gift from the
                    god, while the one who lost the purse is grateful to the
                    Lord of Shadows for accepting a respectful sacrifice of a
                    small portion of his goods. Of course, nothing prevents
                    another pickpocket from targeting someone who has lost
                    Mask's purse, but anyone with the ill luck to attract
                    multiple pickpockets in a single outing has probably earned
                    Mask's ire anyway.

                    Priests of Mask are usually thieves by profession, and often
                    serve as higher-ups in the local underworld or criminal
                    syndicate. They go by the title of demarche or demarchess,
                    and wear veil-masks when acting in their priestly capacity.

                    People rarely speak of Mielikki except in quiet forest
                    spaces. Woodlands that evoke wonder are where she reigns
                    supreme, but she is said to keep watch over good folk in any
                    forest, not matter how dark or cruel. When children are lost
                    in the woods, people beseech Mielikki to protect them until
                    they are found.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mielikki is the goddess of the forest and the creatures that
                    live within it. She is seen as a remote and spiritual deity-
                    less human-like than many other gods. She's not unmindful of
                    people, but her attention and favor are difficult to
                    attract. She is the patron of rangers in the same way that
                    Milil is the patron of bards, but even rangers rarely pray
                    to her directly. They instead pray to Gwaeron Windstrom, who
                    they believe will carry their words to the goddess by
                    tracking her to whichever forest she hides in.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mielikki's symbol is a unicorn, which prompts some to think
                    of her as such and conflate her with Lurue, Queen of the
                    Unicorns and the actual goddess of their kind. But most
                    tales depict Mielikki as a beautiful woman whom Lurue allows
                    upon her back as a rider, and the two are thought to be boon
                    companions. Mielikki's relationships with other deities of
                    the natural world are more complex. Silvanus is sometimes
                    thought of as her father and Eldath is considered her
                    sister, but Mielikki walks her own path through the wilds.

                    She has many shrines, particularly in the Savage Frontier.
                    Most consist of a dead tree trunk into which has been carved
                    a likeness of her holy symbol, a unicorn's head.
                    Alternatively, the likeness might be carved on a separate
                    piece of wood and tacked to a living tree. These shrines
                    typically mark the point in a forest beyond which locals
                    know not to cut timber or hunt. Often these tributes are
                    created by loggers at the end of a logging excursion as a
                    mark of thanks to the goddess for providing the wood and for
                    keeping the timber cutters safe during the work.

                    Milil is the god of poetry, eloquence, and song. He is a god
                    of creativity and inspiration, of the entire song more than
                    just the lyrics or the music. He represents the finished
                    thought, the result of the process that takes an idea from
                    conception to realization. Milil is most venerated by bards,
                    troubadours, and other entertainers, but anyone preparing to
                    entertain or speak before a crowd might offer Milil a brief
                    prayer for a successful performance. Those who seek
                    inspiration in a creative endeavor also pray to Milil.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    His icons depict him as a handsome male, sometimes a human,
                    sometimes an elf, and even a half-elf in places (such as
                    Aglarond) that have a large half-elf population. He is
                    variously depicted as young or old, but his identity is
                    always apparent because of his five-stringed harp made of
                    silvery leaves, which he carries constantly. He is the ideal
                    to which all performers aspire: poised and confident,
                    winningly charismatic, and a source of inspiration for those
                    who listen to him. He is said to have total recall of
                    anything he hears or that is spoken while music plays, as
                    well as utmost skill at improvisation.

                  <p>
                    Holy sites dedicated to Milil are often found in performance
                    venues and schools of music. Whether the site is a vast
                    concert hall or a small choral chamber, it must have
                    excellent acoustic qualities. Milil's priests are patrons of
                    the arts in addition to being performers themselves, and
                    they frequently act as tutors in the arts of performance at
                    his shrines and temples.

                  <p>
                    Like Deneir, Milil is sometimes thought of as being in
                    service to Oghma. In these portrayals of the deity, Milil is
                    the god's left hand, also referred to as the One True Hand.
                    This expression isn't meant to denigrate the right hand
                    (Deneir); rather, it stems from the fact that
                    left-handedness is more often associated with great artistic
                    ability and the belief that the greatest a rt comes from the
                    ~cc pt ce of truth.

                    Myrkul is an ancient god, one of three former mortals who
                    were raised to deityhood whenJergal grew weary of his divine
                    duties and distributed his influence between them. Myrkul
                    became the god of death and the dead, and ruled over the
                    City of the Dead for centuries until he, in turn, was slain.
                    In time Myrkul returned, for can death itself truly ever
                    die? Myrkul's faithful see him as the Reaper, who lays claim
                    to souls and brings them to Kelemvor to be judged.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Myrkul is a deity of death, decay, old age, exhaustion,
                    dusk, and autumn. He's the god of the ending of things and
                    hopelessness, as much as Lathander is the god of beginnings
                    and hope. Folk don't pray to Myrkul so much as dread him and
                    blame him for aching bones and fading vision. Myrkul is
                    thought to be passionless and uncaring even of his most
                    devout worshipers. Those who take Myrkul as a patron tend to
                    be morose, taciturn, and obsessed with the dead and the
                    undead. Like many followers ofKelemvor andJergal, priests
                    ofMyrkul serve as undertakers and typically keep their
                    patron's identity secret.

                    Shrines to Myrkul or engravings of his holy symbol appear in
                    many places where humans bury their dead, but full-fledged
                    temples are rare. The few that exist are hallowed places
                    where the dead from hundreds of miles around a re brought
                    for internment, even if they were not of Myrkul's fa ith.
                    There is little space set aside for the living in such a
                    location, usually a single modest shrine, but its catacombs
                    and ossuaries are vast. In the deepest chamber of each
                    temple rests a throne, and upon that throne sits the
                    doomwarden- the preserved corpse of the most revered saint
                    in the history of the temple (often its founder). Initiates
                    to the faith are brought to kneel before a temple's
                    doomwarden, where they must spend a night and a day fasting
                    and meditating in complete darkness.

                    Mystra is the goddess of magic, and with that the goddess of
                    possibilities. She is venerated by mages and by those who
                    use magic or magical objects in their daily lives. She also
                    receives the prayers of those who find magic wondrous or
                    encounter magic they fear. Mystra is the goddess of the
                    essential force that makes a ll spellcasting possible. She
                    provides and tends the Weave, the conduit through which
                    mortal spellcasters and magical crafters can safely access
                    the raw force of magic.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The faith of Mystra is pervasive in Faer&ucirc;n, which is
                    to be expected for a land as touched by magic as it is. Her
                    worshipers include those who use magic or work closely with
                    it, such as alchemists and s ages. The blue-clad priests of
                    Mystran temples count wizards and sorcerers among their
                    numbers, as well as the occasional bard. The goal of
                    Mystra's faithful is simple: that magic be preserved and
                    promulgated throughout the Realms. It isn't unusual for her
                    followers to keep an eye out for those who demonstrate high
                    potentia l for using magic and help arrange for such persons
                    to find tutelage with a suitable mentor.

                    Oghma is the god of inspiration, invention, and knowledge.
                    Above all else, Oghma represents knowledge in its most
                    supreme, raw form- the idea. An aphorism cited by his
                    faithful about this concept serves them as a prayer when it
                    is repeated aloud: "An idea has no heft but it can move
                    mountains. An idea has no authority but it can dominate
                    people. An idea has no strength but it can push aside
                    empires. Knowledge is the greatest tool of the mortal mind,
                    outweighing anything made by mortal hands. Before anything
                    else can exist, the idea must exist."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Oghma's faithful spread knowledge and literacy as widely as
                    possible, believing that minds ought never to be shackled by
                    ignorance and thus not be able to bequeath the benefit they
                    might otherwise provide their fellows. Not surprisingly,
                    those who follow Oghma oppose those who fo ster deceit,
                    trickery, and ignorance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Folk of many professions favor the Binder: wizards,
                    cartographers, artists, bards, clerks, inventors, sages,
                    scribes, and all manner of others who uncover, preserve, and
                    create knowledge and learning. The worship of Oghma was, at
                    one point, one of the few organized faiths in FaerOn that
                    had an established orthodoxy and a complete network of
                    temples that adhered to that orthodoxy. Schisms during the
                    Time of Troubles shattered that network, and now the
                    structures that house the faith are individual temples or
                    small networks of allied temples, much in the manner of
                    other faiths.

                    The Red Knight is the goddess of planning and strategy.
                    Those who favor her call themselves the Red Fellowship. They
                    believe wars are won by the best planning, strategy, and
                    tactics. The worship of the Red Knight is fi lled with
                    doctrine about strategy, such as: "Every war is a series of
                    battles. Losing one doesn't mean losing the war." "In war,
                    plan for peace. In peace, plan for war." "Seek allies among
                    your enemy's enemies."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Worship of the Red Knight arose among a hero-venerating
                    monastic order of Tempus in Tethyr shortly after the Time of
                    Troubles. The Red Knight has since grown in popularity
                    because of what her followers call the Great Stratagem: for
                    decades, her priests have been traveling to places of
                    warfare to educate generals and kings in the arts of
                    strategy and battlefield tactics. Many of the leaders they
                    approached turned them away at first, but it soon became
                    apparent that those who accepted the counsel of the Crimson
                    General's followers gained a distinct benefit. Grateful
                    victors built temples to the Lady of Strategy, and gradua
                    lly her faith spread.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Today, followers of the Red Knight can be found in nearly
                    any land that has seen warfare in the past century.
                    Worshipers of the Red Knight are rare in the general
                    population, but those who revere her can frequently be found
                    among high-ranking commanders of armies, instructors in
                    colleges of war, quartermasters, and the authors of tomes of
                    strategy. Each temple to the Red Knight includes an altar
                    dedicated to Tempus, and so such a place is likely to be
                    frequented by mercenaries and soldiers. A temple is
                    surrounded by a vast pavilion and courtyard, which can be
                    rented by companies of soldiers and mercenaries for practice
                    and training. Her priests believe that drilling one's troops
                    in a temple courtyard is a form of propitiation that the Red
                    Knight looks upon with special favor.

                    Savras is a god of divination and fortunetelling. Few people
                    worship him, but many pray to him when performing small
                    rituals of foresight. For example, young men and women
                    sometimes attempt to divine the names of their future
                    spouses by saying a rhyming chant that calls upon Savras
                    while gazing in a mirror.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Savras has no currently active temples in Faer&ucirc;n, and
                    his shrines are few and far between, tucked away in the
                    corners of libraries and scriptoria. Despite this lack of
                    prominence, certain folk pay regular homage to Savras,
                    including investigators, diviners, judges, and others who
                    have a need to uncover the truth. S uch individuals can
                    sometimes be identified by the elaborate staffs they carry
                    in homage to Savras. According to legend, Savras was trapped
                    in Azuth's staff for ages. Azuth eventually freed Savras so
                    long as Savras swore fealty, and today the staff is a potent
                    symbol for those who revere Savras. Devout worshipers take
                    great pains to decorate and embellish their staffs, each
                    hoping that Savras might find it a welcoming place to stop
                    for a time.

                    Sel&ucirc;ne is thought to be among the most ancient of
                    Faerun's deities. Most humans in Faer&ucirc;n consider the
                    moon in the sky to literally be the goddess gazing down on
                    the world, and the trailing motes of light behind it her
                    tears. She is also a goddess of stars and navigation as well
                    as motherhood and reproductive cycles. She is seen as a calm
                    power, frequently venerated by female humans as well as by a
                    mix of other folk: navigators and sailors, those who work
                    honestly at night, those seeking protection in the dark, the
                    lost, and the questing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are many legends about Sel&ucirc;ne, chief among them
                    being the tale of the battle at the beginning of time
                    between Sel&ucirc;ne and her sister, Shar. The Tears of
                    Selune, the cluster of starry lights that follow the moon
                    around the sky, are thought to be brought about by the
                    goddess's joy, sorrow, or both.

                    Milk, a symbol of motherhood, is used in many rites
                    performed by the worshipers of Sel&ucirc;ne, as are trances
                    and meditation. Those who favor her typically set a bowl of
                    milk outside on each night of the full moon.

                    The dark twin of Sel&ucirc;ne, Shar is the goddess of
                    darkness, both in its physical form and as it exists in the
                    minds and souls of mortals. People worship Shar as the
                    goddess of night, secrets, loss, and forgetfulness. She
                    represents pains hidden but not forgotten, and vengeances
                    .carefully nurtured away from the light. She is said to have
                    the power to make folk forget their pain or become inured to
                    a loss, and many people in distress pray to Shar for such a
                    blessing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Shar is revered by those who must venture into dark places
                    and so pray to her for protection, such as miners, as well
                    as by those who have fallen into melancholy and despair, who
                    wish to forget something, or who have lost something and
                    wish to recover it. Priests drawn to serve Shar often
                    nurture their own deep wounds or dark secrets, which in
                    their minds makes them best suited to console those who
                    suffer from a simila r ill. Throughout the world's history,
                    many followers of Shar have done dark deeds in her name-
                    most notably the shadovar of Netheril, an entire society
                    dedicated to Shar. The tragedies and losses brought about by
                    the fanaticism of her followers have caused many places to
                    outlaw her worship and thus driven most of her priests into
                    secrecy, but such prohibitions only heighten the priests'
                    umbrage at authorities and make the faithful a focal point
                    for rebellion and revenge against whoever rules.

                  <p>
                    Silvanus represents the entirety of nature, deserts as well
                    as forests, sharks as much as deer. But folk in the North,
                    who contend with the dangers of forests, mountains, and
                    plains, see Silvanus more as a god of those places. Silvanus
                    is thought of as a grim and severe father figure who metes
                    out flood and drought, fire and ice, and life and death in
                    the wilderness. In legends he often commands other nature
                    deities, dealing out rewards and punishments to them as is
                    fitting.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nature and its impartial fairness is central to the dogma of
                    Silvanus's faith. His priests seek to know the total
                    situation, to view the macrocosm; their viewpoint isn't
                    confined to one person's or one nation's idea of what is
                    best. The loss of a farming community to goblin raids is a
                    tragedy for some, but the event provides an opportunity for
                    the wilderness to grow up and make the land fertile again,
                    which in turn provides new challenges for those who would
                    return to tame it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The creed of Silvanus dictates that nature's glory must be
                    preserved not merely because nature is beautiful, but
                    because wild nature is the true state of the world. Its
                    expanses refresh and revitalize the mortal soul, and give
                    breath to all the world. Many of his faithful oppose the
                    expansion of settlements into wild places, and consider
                    excessive consumption of natural resources to be not only
                    wasteful but blasphemous.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Silvanus often receives veneration from travelers in wild
                    lands, explorers, and residents of rural communities far
                    from the protection of a local lord or a great city. The oak
                    leaf is Silvanus's symbol, and a grove of oak trees within a
                    village or on its outskirts is often dedicated as a shrine
                    to him. In rural places where oak trees don't grow, an oak
                    leaf etched into the bark of another kind of tree signifies
                    a sacred site.

                    Sune Firehair is a deity of passion and the delights of the
                    senses. She is the goddess of beauty in all its forms-not
                    just pleasing sights, but also enchanting sounds, luxurious
                    tastes and scents, and the exquisite pleasures of the flesh,
                    from a lover's caress to the brush of silk on the skin. Her
                    worshipers seek out these pleasures in life, not out of mere
                    decadence, but because the experience of pleasure is the
                    touch of Sune herself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The followers of Sune have a reputation as hedonists, and so
                    they are, to a degree. More than that, her priests foster
                    beauty in the world. They do so by creating art, by acting
                    as patrons for promising talents, and by investing in
                    merchants who bring luxuries to far-off places that have
                    never seen satin or tasted a luscious wine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Her priests consider loveliness to be one of their greatest
                    callings, and all are trained in comportment, fashion, and
                    cosmetics. Indeed, so ta lented are Sune's priests in the
                    creation of beautiful appearances that many take pride in
                    their ability to present themselves as stunningly attractive
                    examples of either gender.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But beauty is more than skin deep, say the Sunites; it
                    issues from the core of one's being and s hows one's true
                    face to the world, whether fair or foul. The followers of
                    Sune are believers in romance, true love winning over all,
                    and following one's heart to one's true destination. Fated
                    matches, impossible loves, and ugly ducklings becoming swans
                    are all in the purview of Sune.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Temples dedicated to Sune are common in human lands, and
                    they frequently serve as public baths and places of
                    relaxation. A temple usually features a mirrored and
                    well-lit salon where folks can primp, as well as see others
                    and be seen. Where a temple doesn't exist, or in a large
                    city where the nearest temple might be too far to walk to, a
                    small shrine to Sune often stands near a street corner.
                    These sites consist of a mirror hung beneath a small roof
                    where one can say a prayer while checking one's appearance.
                    The spot might feature a shelf or a cupboard holding various
                    perfumes and cosmetics so that those without the funds to
                    purchase such items can still make themselves feel
                    beautiful.

                  <p>
                    One of the most often beseeched of Faer&ucirc;n's deities,
                    Talona is the goddess of disease and poison, blamed for
                    everything from common illnesses to crop failure to brackish
                    wells to plague. Depicted in temple iconography as a
                    withered crone with a cup or a vase that holds all the
                    varieties of disease and poison, Talona is a fearsome
                    goddess, and many are the prayers that beg her for
                    protection from illness and poison. Various rituals to
                    placate her involve the use of three drops of blood or three
                    tears- to be dropped into a well that has gone bad, dripped
                    into the handkerchief of someone beset by coughing, dropped
                    into a fire made by burning a withered crop, dripped into
                    the mouth of a plague sufferer, and so on. It's common
                    practice to mark a container of poison with her holy symbol,
                    three droplets in a triangle, and during epidemics folk
                    paint the same image on the homes of the infected.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Though she is often the recipient of prayers, Talona has
                    almost no temples and few cults dedicated to her. A cult or
                    a shrine to her might arise in an area after it suffers from
                    pestilence, when some of those who survived decide to revere
                    her or even become priests.

                    Talos is the dark side of nature, the uncaring and
                    destructive force that might strike at any time. He is the
                    god of storms, forest fires, earthquakes, tornadoes, and
                    general destruction. He counts the ravager, the raider, the
                    looter, and the brigand among his followers. Those who favor
                    him see life as a succession of random effects in a sea of
                    chaos, so the devout should grab what they can, when they
                    can-for who can say when Talos will strike and send them
                    into the afterlife?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Talos is portrayed as a broad-shouldered, bearded young man
                    with a single good eye, the other covered by a dark patch.
                    He is said to carry a collection of three staffs, made from
                    the first tree cut down in the world, the first silver
                    smelted, and the first iron forged. He uses these staffs to
                    raise destructive winds, cause terrible storms, and split
                    the land in acts of rage. The three lightning bolts of his
                    holy symbol represent these staffs, and when he vents his
                    wrath on the world, he is thought to hurl them down from the
                    sky as lightning strikes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although Talos is a popular deity, his name is invoked more
                    often out of fear than out of reverence. He does have
                    priests, mostly traveling doomsayers, who warn of disasters
                    to come and accept charity in exchange for blessings of
                    protection. Many of his faithful wear a black eyepatch, even
                    if both eyes are intact.

                  <p>
                    Tempus is a war god concerned with brave conduct during war,
                    using force of arms over talk for settling disputes, and
                    encouraging bloodshed. The god of war is random in his
                    favors, meaning that his chaotic nature favors all sides
                    equally. Lord Tempus might be an army's ally one day, and
                    its enemy the next. He might seem to manifest before a
                    battle, appearing to one side or the other. If he is seen
                    riding a white mare (Veiros), then the army will succeed. If
                    he rides a black stallion (Deiros), then defeat is certain.
                    Most often he appears to be riding with one foot in each
                    mount's stirrup, signifying the unpredictable nature of
                    battle. In such visions, Tempus is always a powerfully built
                    warrior dressed for battle in the style of those who
                    envision him.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Tempus's favor might be randomly distributed, but over the
                    centuries his priests have made an effort to spread and
                    enforce a common code of warfare-to make war a thing of
                    rules, respect for reputations, and professional behavior.
                    This code, called Tempus's Honor, has the purpose of making
                    conflicts brief, decisive, and as safe as possible for those
                    not directly involved. The rules in the code include the
                    following: arm anyone who has need of a weapon; disparage no
                    foe; acquit oneself with bravery; train all for battle; and
                    don't engage in feuds. Those who poison wells, taint fields,
                    kill noncombatants, or engage in torture in the name of war
                    are all considered sinners.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Worshipers of Tempus are legion, and his name is often on
                    the lips of soldiers. His priests are tacticians, often
                    skilled in the art of war. Many of his ordained don't serve
                    in temples, but as battlefield chaplains with armies and
                    mercenary companies, encouraging their fellow soldiers with
                    both word and blade. Priests of Tempus teach that war
                    conducted properly is fair in that it oppresses all sides
                    equally, and that in any given battle,a mortal might be
                    slain or might become a great leader among his or her
                    companions. Mortals shouldn't fear war but should see it as
                    a natural force, the storm that civilization brings about by
                    its very existence.

                  <p>
                    Torm is the god of duty and loyalty, revered by those who
                    face danger to bring about a greater good. Those who favor
                    Torm believe that one's salvation can be found through
                    service, that every fa ilure to perform one's duty
                    diminishes Torm, and that every success adds to his luster.
                    Those who take Torm to heart must strive to fulfill his
                    commandment to go out into the world and be an active force
                    for good, to right wrongs, and to help the hopeless. They
                    must strive to maintain peace and order while opposing
                    unjust laws. Followers of Torm stand ever alert against
                    corruption and are expected to strike quickly and hard
                    against any evidence of rot in the hearts of mortals. As the
                    sword arm of justice, Torm's fa ithful are expected to bring
                    quick deaths to betrayers. Considering these tenets, it
                    should be no surprise that most human paladins have Torm as
                    their patron.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most temples dedicated to Torm are fortresses built on
                    heights. These structures offer austere quarters for
                    residents and visiting knights, drilling grounds, and
                    stables. White granite, lion statues, and armored figures
                    predominate in the architecture, with the coats of arms of
                    fallen heroes decorating the walls of the great halls.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Torm is seen as the good right hand of Tyr, and a such his
                    symbol is a white gauntlet made for the right hand. It
                    represents Tyr's sword hand, but it is also a symbol of
                    forbearance. Torm is frequently depicted with his right
                    gauntlet extended palm forward, which worshipers call the
                    Hand Resolute. It signifies the principle that the just and
                    true must pause before acting to judge whether their
                    intentions uphold Torm's ideals. Temples, civic structures,
                    and the homes of the faithful are often decorated with
                    images of the Hand Resolute as a constant reminder of this
                    principle.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Worshipers of Torm come from most walks of life, for he
                    welcomes any who seek the best in themselves and others, who
                    uphold his tenets of loyalty, responsibility, duty, and
                    kindness, or who are willing to sacrifice to keep evil from
                    gaining ascendancy in the world. The faithful know that all
                    of them will stumble from time to time while following in
                    Torm's footsteps, but Torm's priests teach that the shame of
                    a minor fa ll from grace is far less severe than declining
                    to rise oneself up to Torm's standards.

                  <p>
                    Tymora is the bright-faced goddess of fortune, the one to
                    whom gamblers and game-players pray in Faer&ucirc;n. Our
                    Smiling Lady is said to love none so much as those who
                    gamble with the utmost skill and daring. Yet she is thought
                    to watch over all who take risks to better their fortunes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The battle cry of the followers of Tymora is "Fortune favors
                    the bold." Someone might say words to Tymora before any
                    endeavor in which a little good luck would help, but not
                    when an incidence of bad luck might occur. (On such
                    occasions folk pray to Beshaba to spare them from bad luck;
                    praying to both is thought to anger both goddesses.) One
                    common method of divining the future is to toss a coin to a
                    stranger (typically a beggar) and ask if it's heads. If it
                    is, the coin is left with the stranger as payment for
                    Tymora's favor. If it's not, the stranger can choose to keep
                    it (and the bad luck) or return it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Those who favor Tymora- as distinct from folk who invoke her
                    name by mumbling over the dice-tend to be daring sorts.
                    Adventurers and gamblers make up much of their ranks. They
                    all have the belief that what is good about their lives is
                    the result of having both good luck and the bravery to seek
                    it out. Tymora has worshipers among all sorts of folk: the
                    dashing young noble, the risk-taking merchant, the
                    daydreaming field hand, and the scheming ne'er-do-well.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Priests of Tymora and temples devoted to Lady Luck are
                    scarce, since her faith tends not to stress a need for
                    intermediaries: "Let the lucky man and the Smiling Lady suss
                    it out," as the old saying goes. Shrines to Tymora at
                    gambling parlors aren't unusual, however, and sometimes such
                    establishments attract a priest and effectively become
                    temples.

                    Tyr Grimjaws, Tyr the Evenhanded, Wounded Tyr, the Maimed
                    God, the Blind, Blind Tyr, the Lord of Justice-all of these
                    names speak to the nature of the in Faer&ucirc;nian god of
                    justice. Tyr appears as a noble warrior missing his right
                    hand, which he lost to Kezef the Chaos Hound in an act of
                    bravery and sacrifice, and with his eyes wrapped in cloth to
                    signify his blindness, caused by a wound dealt to him by Ao
                    when he questioned the justice of the Overgod's actions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Tyr's followers devote themselves to the cause of justice,
                    to the righting of wrongs and the deliverance of vengeance.
                    This devotion isn't necessarily concerned with equality or
                    fairness, but rather the discovery of truth and the
                    punishment of the guilty. Those who favor Tyr tend to be
                    stiff-necked about matters of theology and laws, seeing
                    things in terms of black and white. Tyr's credo of
                    lawfulness and honesty is a demanding one, and his priests
                    remind the faithful not to hold in contempt others who can't
                    live by it- it wouldn't be an honorable calling if everyone
                    could muster the strength of will to follow it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Many orders of knighthood are devoted to Tyr, including the
                    Knights of Holy Judgment and the Knights of the Merciful
                    Sword. Such knights-as well as judges and priests, clerics,
                    and paladins who worship Tyr- sometimes wear thin strips of
                    diaphanous cloth over their eyes to remind others of the
                    blindness of justice.

                    No community that lives by the sea can ignore the influence
                    of Umberlee, the furious goddess whose tempestuous nature
                    reflects and is reflected by the waters of the deep. Any
                    such community makes sure to host festivals to propitiate
                    the Wavemother and seek her favor. Although mercurial in
                    temperament, she can be generous to those who do her honor,
                    as is any great queen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Bitch Queen is worshiped out of fear instead of
                    adoration, and ship crews offer her gems, tossed over the
                    side, to calm storm-tossed waters. As her most common
                    moniker suggests, she is viewed as capricious and cruel with
                    no firm ethical outlook; the sea is a savage place, and
                    those who travel it had best be willing to pay the price of
                    challenging her domain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There is little in the way of an organized clergy of
                    Umberlee. Her priests roam coasta l cities, warning of doom
                    and demanding free passage on ships in return for ensuring
                    the goddess's pleasure. Often they wear the colors of waves
                    and storms, and they decorate themselves with items that
                    remind others of the sea's dangerous nature- a necklace of
                    shark teeth, seaweed wrapped about a h1,1man bone, and so
                    on. The preserved hand of a drowned person is thought to be
                    a pa rticularly holy object, and some of her few clerics use
                    such severed hands as holy symbols. Umberlee does have a
                    large number of shrines in the coastal cities, and sailors
                    often leave flowers or small candies at them in hopes that
                    she will spare them on their next voyage. Both Waterdeep and
                    Baldur's Gate have true temples dedicated to Umberlee,
                    staffed largely by the widows of sailors lost at sea.

                  <p>
                    Waukeen is the goddess of wealth and trade, on both sides of
                    the law. Her most ardent worshipers include shopkeepers,
                    members of trading costers, wealthy merchants, caravan
                    guides, itinerant peddlers, moneychangers, and smugglers.
                    She is interested in anything that increases trade and the
                    flow of money, whether new trade routes, new inventions, or
                    the whim of changing fashion. Those who take Waukeen as a
                    patron can be reliably thought of as greedy, but the
                    Coinmaiden is s aid to frown upon misers and smile upon the
                    industrious and the profligate, and thus priests who bear
                    her holy symbol find themselves welcome in many towns and
                    cities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Temples ofWaukeen resemble guildhalls and often serve as
                    meeting places for trade consortiums. Those who follow
                    Waukeen's ethos seek to create more opportunity for all and
                    see competition for wealth as one of society's main means of
                    progress. Thus, the faithful of Our Lady of Gold often find
                    themselves at odds with trade guilds and others who would
                    form monopolies. It's common practice among those who seek
                    Waukeen's favor to set aside a tithe of ten percent of their
                    profits, but rather than being given to a temple, the money
                    is meant to be spent to help a struggling business, to
                    finance a new endeavor, or, if all else fails, on frivolous
                    fun.
