                      <p>Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character’s identity. The most important question to ask about your background is what changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don't you have more money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?</p>

                      <p>Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills. In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools.</p>
                      <p>If a character would gain the sam e proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.</p>

                      <h6>Customizing a Background</h6>
                      <p>You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear. (if you spend coin, you cant also take the equipment package suggested for your class. ) finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you cant find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your dm to create one.</p>

                      <p>Fleshing out your character’s personality—the array of traits, mannerisms, habits, beliefs, and flaws that give a person a unique identity—will help you bring him or her to life as you play the game. Four categories of characteristics are presented here: personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories, think about your character’s favorite words or phrases, tics and habitual gestures, vices and pet peeves, and whatever else you can imagine</p>
                      <p>Each background presented later in this chapter includes suggested characteristics that you can use to spark your imagination. You’re not bound to those options, but they’re a good starting point.</p>
                      <div class="light-horizontal-line"></div>
                      <h6>Personality Traits</h6>
                      <p>Give your character two personality traits. Personality traits are small, simple ways to help you set your character apart from every other character. Your personality traits should tell you something interesting and fun about your character. They should be self-descriptions that are specific about what makes your character stand out. “I’m smart” is not a good trait, because it describes a lot of characters. “I’ve read every book in Candlekeep” tells you something specific about your character’s interests and disposition.</p>
                      <p>Personality traits might describe the things your character likes, his or her past accomplishments, things your character dislikes or fears, your character’s self-attitude or mannerisms, or the influence of his or her ability scores.</p>
                      <p>A useful place to start thinking about personality traits is to look at your highest and lowest ability scores and define one trait related to each. Either one could be positive or negative: you might work hard to overcome a low score, for example, or be cocky about your high score.</p>
                      <div class="light-horizontal-line"></div>
                      <h6>Ideals</h6>
                      <p>Describe one ideal that drives your character. Your ideals are the things that you believe in m ost strongly, the fundamental moral and ethical principles that com pel you to act as you do. Ideals encompass everything from your life goals to your core belief system</p>
                      <p>Ideals might answer any of these questions: What are the principles that you will never betray? What would prompt you to make sacrifices? What drives you to act and guides your goals and ambitions? What is the single most important thing you strive for?</p>
                      <p>You can choose any ideals you like, but your character’s alignment is a good place to start defining them. Each background in this chapter includes six suggested ideals. Five of them are linked to aspects of alignment: law, chaos, good, evil, and neutrality. The last one has more to do with the particular background than with moral or ethical perspectives.</p>
                      <div class="light-horizontal-line"></div>
                      <h6>Bonds</h6>
                      <p>Create one bond for your character. Bonds represent a character’s connections to people, places, and events in the world. They tie you to things from your background. They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead you to act against your own best interests if they are threatened. They can work very much like ideals, driving a character’s motivations and goals.</p>
                      <p>Bonds might answer any of these questions: Whom do you care most about? To what place do you feel a special connection? What is your most treasured possession?</p>
                      <p>Your bonds might be tied to your class, your background, your race, or some other aspect of your character’s history or personality. You might also gain new bonds over the course of your adventures</p>
                      <div class="light-horizontal-line"></div>
                      <h6>Flaws</h6>
                      <p>Finally, choose a flaw for your character. Your character’s flaw represents some vice, compulsion, fear, or weakness—in particular, anything that someone else could exploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to act against your best interests. More significant than negative personality traits, a flaw might answer any of these questions: What enrages you? What’s the one person, concept, or event that you are terrified of? What are your vices?</p>

      <p>Inspiration is a rule the Dungeon Master can use to reward you for playing your character in a way that’s true to his or her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw. By using inspiration, you can draw on your personality trait of compassion for the downtrodden to give you an edge in negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or inspiration can let you call on your bond to the defense of your home village to push past the effect of a spell that has been laid on you.</p>
      <div class="light-horizontal-line"></div>
      <h6>Gaining Inspiration</h6>
      <p>Your DM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety of reasons. Typically, DMs award it when you play out your personality traits, give in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your character in a compelling way. Your DM will tell you how you can earn inspiration in the game.</p>
      <p>You either have inspiration or you don’t—you can’t stockpile multiple “inspirations” for later use.</p>
      <h6>Using Inspiration</h6>
      <p>If you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending your inspiration gives you advantage on that roll.</p>
      <p>Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply doing something exciting in the game. When another player character does something that really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can give up your inspiration to give that character inspiration.</p>
